History of Western Philosophy[a] is a 1946 book by British philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970). A survey of Western philosophy from the pre-Socratic philosophers to the early 20th century, each major division of the book is prefaced by an account of the historical background necessary to understand the currents of thought it describes.[1] When Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950, A History of Western Philosophy was cited as one of the books that won him the award. Its success provided Russell with financial security for the last part of his life. The book was criticised, however, for overgeneralizations and omissions, particularly from the post-Cartesian period, but nevertheless became a popular and commercial success, and has remained in print from its first publication.



## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy

Western philosophy refers to the philosophical thought, traditions and works of the Western world. Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of Western culture, beginning with the ancient Greek philosophy of the pre-Socratics. The word philosophy itself originated from the Ancient Greek philosophía (φιλοσοφία), literally, "the love of wisdom" Ancient Greek: φιλεῖν phileîn, "to love" and σοφία sophía, "wisdom".

## Ancient Western Philosophy



## Medieval Western Philosophy 
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy#Medieval

Medieval philosophy roughly extends from the Christianization of the Roman Empire until the Renaissance.[37] It is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical Greek and Hellenistic philosophy, and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then-widespread sacred doctrines of Abrahamic religion (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) with secular learning. Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of faith to reason, the existence and unity of God, the object of theology and metaphysics, the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.

A prominent figure of this period was Augustine of Hippo, one of the most important Church Fathers in Western Christianity. Augustine adopted Plato's thought and Christianized it. His influence dominated medieval philosophy perhaps up to the end of era and the rediscovery of Aristotle's texts. Augustinianism was the preferred starting point for most philosophers up until the 13th century. Among the issues his philosophy touched upon were the problem of evil, just war and what time is. On the problem of evil, he argued that evil was a necessary product of human free will.[38] When this raised the issue of the incompatibility of free will and divine foreknowledge, both he and Boethius solved the issue by arguing that God did not see the future, but rather stood outside of time entirely.[


### Scholasticism

經院哲學（英語：scholasticism，字源為拉丁语的schola與scholasticus），又稱士林哲學，意指學院（英語：academy）的學問。起初受到神秘、講究直觀的教父哲學影響，尤以奧古斯丁主義為最，後來又受到亞里斯多德哲學啟發[1]。

经院哲学是中世纪的哲学学派，强调将信仰与理性结合，它采用一种批判性的哲学分析方法，该方法以拉丁禮天主教會有神论课程为基础，该课程在大约1100年至1700年间主导了欧洲中世纪大学的教学。它起源于基督教修道院学校，这些学校是最早的欧洲大学。[2]

经院哲学与其说是一种哲学或神学，不如说是一种学习方法，因为它非常强调辩证推理，通过推理来扩展知识并解决矛盾。经院哲学思想也以严格的概念分析和仔细区分区别而闻名。在课堂和写作中，往往采取显性辩论的形式； 从传统中提取的主题以问题的形式提出，给出反对的回应，提出反建议并反驳反对的论点。由于强调严谨的辩证方法，经院哲学最终被应用于许多其他研究领域。[3][4]

经院哲学开始于中世纪基督教思想家试图各種协调的尝试 -协调他们自己传统的各种权威；协调基督教神学与古典和晚期古代哲学，尤其是亚里士多德和新柏拉图主义。

## Contemporary Western Philosophy
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy#Contemporary

The three major contemporary approaches to academic philosophy are analytic philosophy, continental philosophy and pragmatism.[109] They are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive.

The 20th century deals with the upheavals produced by a series of conflicts within philosophical discourse over the basis of knowledge, with classical certainties overthrown, and new social, economic, scientific and logical problems. 20th-century philosophy was set for a series of attempts to reform and preserve and to alter or abolish, older knowledge systems. Seminal figures include Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The publication of Husserl's Logical Investigations (1900–1) and Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903) is considered to mark the beginning of 20th-century philosophy.[110] The 20th century also saw the increasing professionalization of the discipline and the beginning of the current (contemporary) era of philosophy.[111]

Since the Second World War, contemporary philosophy has been divided mostly into analytic and continental traditions; the former carried in the English speaking world and the latter on the continent of Europe. The perceived conflict between continental and analytic schools of philosophy remains prominent, despite increasing skepticism regarding the distinction's usefulness.
