#### Federal Reserve System (The Fed)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve

The **Federal Reserve System** (often shortened to the **Federal Reserve**, or simply the **Fed**) is the central banking system of the United States. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises. Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.

Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Its duties have expanded over the years, and currently also include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed also conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the  [Beige Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beige_Book "Beige Book") and the [FRED database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRED_database "FRED database")

New to the U.S., or just need to brush-up on **some government basics?** Here's a quick run-down of U.S. government at various levels and how to find government information. (I'll be writing two follow-up posts that tell where to find primary source information for each branch of government, and show an example of a gov info search.) First, here is a **[U.S. government chart](http://www.netage.com/economics/gov/images-org/gov_chart-landscape.pdf)** and **three basic guides** to the **federal government**:

- [Ben's Guide](http://bensguide.gpo.gov/9-12/index.html)
- [The U.S. Government Manual](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GOVMAN-2013-11-06/pdf/GOVMAN-2013-11-06.pdf)
- [How Laws Are Made](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDOC-110hdoc49/pdf/CDOC-110hdoc49.pdf)


**Levels & Branches of Government**

The United States has several **levels** of government: **federal**, **state**, and **local** (county/city). **Federal** is the overarching national government, which has [**three branches**](http://www.house.gov/content/learn/branches_of_government/):
- **Legislative** (makes the law)
    - Composed of [Congress](http://congress.gov/), which is made up of the [House](http://www.house.gov/) and the [Senate](http://www.senate.gov/)
- **Executive** (implements and enforces the law)
    - Composed of the [President](http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration) and many [federal departments, agencies, and offices](http://www.usa.gov/Agencies.shtml)
- **Judicial**(interprets the law)
    - Composed of the [Supreme Court](http://www.supremecourt.gov/) and the [federal court system](http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts.aspx)

Each [**state** has its own government](http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/state-and-local-government) which echoes the federal government in its three-branch organization. The Legislative branch is composed of the state senate and house (or assembly), the Executive branch is composed of the Governor and typically many departments (structure varies by state), and the Judicial branch is composed of the state court system, headed by the state supreme court. There are different **local government** offices at the county and the municipal (city/town) level. Typically, cities follow a similar pattern to federal and state government, with a Mayor acting as the chief executive officer of a city. Usually, a county is larger than and encompasses many cities and towns. However, [New York City](http://www1.nyc.gov/) is made up of five boroughs, which are each actually counties.


**What Topics are Covered by Government Documents?**

The U.S. government covers a surprising number of programs, and thus data and information is available on nearly any topic you can think of, including:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|- Data & Statistics<br>- Health & Vital Statistics<br>- Politics & Law<br>- Business & Economy<br>- Treaties<br>- Scientific & Medical Research|- Technology<br>- Intellectual Property (patents, trademarks, copyright)<br>- Historical Events (primary resources)<br>- Consumer Information<br>- Grants<br>- Starting & Financing a Small Business|- Recipes & Nutrition<br>- Maps<br>- Education, Teacher Resources<br>- Rules & Regulations<br>- …and you can use [**Browse Topics**](http://www.browsetopics.gov/) or the [**US Gov Portal**](http://www.usa.gov/) to find more!|

Some of the **few topics that aren't covered well** in U.S. gov info include:
- Literature
- Arts
    - Exceptions: arts funding (NEA, NEH), nonprofit finances, & some gov-funded museum exhibits are covered; in addition, Whistler briefly worked for the Coastal Survey and produced engravings
- Music
    - Exception: music copyright and copyright cases are well covered
