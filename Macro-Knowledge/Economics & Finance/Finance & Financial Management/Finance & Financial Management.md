### Financial Instrument
Financial instruments are **assets or contracts used in financial markets for trading, investment, or managing risks**. They include equities, bonds, derivatives, and cash instruments. These tools allow investors and organizations to manage funds, gain returns, or hedge against potential losses

Financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties. They can be created, traded, modified and settled. They can be cash (currency), evidence of an ownership, interest in an entity or a contractual right to receive or deliver in the form of currency (forex); debt (bonds, loans); equity (shares); or derivatives (options, futures, forwards).

International Accounting Standards IAS 32 and 39 define a financial instrument as "any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity".

Financial instruments may be categorized by "asset class" depending on whether they are foreign exchange-based (reflecting foreign exchange instruments and transactions), equity-based (reflecting ownership of the issuing entity) or debt-based (reflecting a loan the investor has made to the issuing entity). If the instrument is debt it can be further categorized into short-term (less than one year) or long-term.
#### Financial Instruments Types
Financial instruments can be either cash instruments or derivative instruments:
- Cash instruments – instruments whose value is determined directly by the [markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_\(economics\) "Market (economics)"). They can be [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_\(finance\) "Security (finance)"), which are readily transferable, and instruments such as [loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loans "Loans") and [deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_\(finance\) "Deposit (finance)"), where both borrower and lender have to agree on a transfer.
- [Derivative instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_\(finance\) "Derivative (finance)") – instruments which derive their value from the value and characteristics of one or more underlying entities such as an [asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset "Asset"), [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_\(economics\) "Index (economics)"), or [interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate"). They can be [exchange-traded derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_\(finance\)#OTC_and_exchange-traded "Derivative (finance)") and [over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_\(finance\)#OTC_and_exchange-traded "Derivative (finance)") Some of the more common derivatives include [forwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_contract "Forward contract"), [futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract "Futures contract"), [options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_\(finance\) "Option (finance)"), [swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_\(finance\) "Swap (finance)"), and variations of these such as synthetic [collateralized debt obligations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation "Collateralized debt obligation") and [credit default swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap "Credit default swap").

In finance, a **derivative** is a contract between a buyer and a seller. The derivative can take various forms, depending on the transaction, but every derivative has the following four elements:
1. an item (the "underlier") that can or must be bought or sold,
2. a future act which must occur (such as a sale or purchase of the underlier),
3. a price at which the future transaction must take place, and
4. a future date by which the act (such as a purchase or sale) must take place.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_\(finance\)#cite_note-1)

A derivative's value depends on the performance of the underlier, which can be a commodity (for example, corn or oil), a financial instrument (e.g. a stock or a bond), [a price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index "Price index"), a [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency "Currency"), or an [interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate").

Derivatives are used for the following:
 - Hedge or to mitigate risk in the underlying, by entering into a derivative contract whose value moves in the opposite direction to their underlying position and cancels part or all of it out
- Create option ability where the value of the derivative is linked to a specific condition or event (e.g., the underlying reaching a specific price level)
- Obtain exposure to the underlying where it is not possible to trade in the underlying (e.g., weather derivatives)
- Provide leverage (or gearing), such that a small movement in the underlying value can cause a large difference in the value of the derivative
- Speculate and make a profit if the value of the underlying asset moves the way they expect (e.g. moves in a given direction, stays in or out of a specified range, reaches a certain level)
- Switch asset allocations between different asset classes without disturbing the underlying assets, as part of transition management
- Avoid paying taxes. For example, an equity swap allows an investor to receive steady payments, e.g. based on SONIA rate, while avoiding paying capital gains tax and keeping the stock.
- For arbitraging purpose, allowing a riskless profit by simultaneously entering into transactions into two or more markets

Some common examples of these derivatives are the following:
