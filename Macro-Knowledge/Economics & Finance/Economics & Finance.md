## ⛱ Intro: Economics
### Goods and Trade (商品与交易)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade

==**Trade** involves the transfer of **goods** and **services** from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for **money**. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a **market**.==

Traders generally negotiate through a **medium of credit or exchange**, such as **money**. Though some economists characterize **barter** (i.e. trading things without the use of money) as an early form of trade, money was invented before written history began. Consequently, any story of how money first developed is mostly based on conjecture and logical inference. Letters of credit, paper money, and non-physical money have greatly simplified and promoted trade as buying can be separated from selling, or earning. Trade between two traders is called **bilateral trade**, while trade involving more than two traders is called **multilateral trade**.

In one modern view, trade exists due to **specialization and the division of labor**, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trade for other products and needs. Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some **tradable goods** – including the production of scarce or limited natural resources elsewhere. For example, different regions' sizes may encourage mass production. In such circumstances, trading at market price between locations can benefit both locations. Different types of traders may specialize in trading different kinds of goods; for example, the spice trade and grain trade have both historically been important in the development of a global, international economy.

**Retail trade** consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store, boutique, or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. **Wholesale trade** is the traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.

Historically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onward (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)

==In economics, a market is a composition of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations or infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange.== While parties may exchange goods and services by **barter**, most markets rely on sellers offering their goods or services (including labour power) to buyers in exchange for **money**. It can be said that a market is the process by which the value of goods and services are established. Markets facilitate trade and enable the distribution and allocation of resources in a society. **Markets allow any tradable item to be evaluated and priced.** A market emerges more or less spontaneously or may be constructed deliberately by human interaction in order to enable the exchange of rights (cf. ownership) of services and goods. Markets generally supplant gift economies and are often held in place through rules and customs, such as a booth fee, competitive pricing, and source of goods for sale (local produce or stock registration).

Markets can differ by products (goods, services) or factors (labour and capital) sold, product differentiation, place in which exchanges are carried, buyers targeted, duration, selling process, government regulation, taxes, subsidies, minimum wages, price ceilings, legality of exchange, liquidity, intensity of speculation, size, concentration, exchange asymmetry, relative prices, volatility and geographic extension. The geographic boundaries of a market may vary considerably, for example the food market in a single building, the real estate market in a local city, the consumer market in an entire country, or the economy of an international trade bloc where the same rules apply throughout. Markets can also be worldwide, see for example the global diamond trade. National economies can also be classified as developed markets or developing markets.

==In mainstream economics, the concept of a market is any structure that allows **buyers** and **sellers** to exchange any type of **goods, services and information**. ==The exchange of goods or services, with or without money, is a **transaction**. Market participants or economic agents consist of all the buyers and sellers of a good who influence its price, which is a major topic of study of economics and has given rise to several theories and models concerning the basic market forces of supply and demand. A major topic of debate is how much a given market can be considered to be a "free market", that is free from government intervention. Microeconomics traditionally focuses on the study of market structure and the efficiency of market equilibrium; when the latter (if it exists) is not efficient, then economists say that a market failure has occurred. However, it is not always clear how the allocation of resources can be improved since there is always the possibility of government failure.

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_group

A **corporate group**, **company group** or **business group**, also formally known as a **group of companies**, is a collection of parent and subsidiary corporations that function as a **single economic entity** through a common source of control. These types of groups are often managed by an account manager. The concept of a group is frequently used in tax law and accounting and (less frequently) company law to attribute the rights and duties of one member of the group to another or the whole. ==If the corporations are engaged in entirely different businesses, the group is called a **conglomerate**.== The forming of corporate groups usually involves consolidation via  [mergers and acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions "Mergers and acquisitions") (M&A), although the group concept focuses on the instances in which the merged and acquired corporate entities remain in existence rather than the instances in which they are dissolved by the parent. The group may be owned by a holding company which may have no actual operations.

**集团公司与企业集团的区别有以下几点：**
1. **法律地位不同**
	1. 企业集团是许多法人组成的联合体，这种联合体将来很可能受合伙企业法调整。而集团公司是法人企业，规范的集团公司及母子公司关系应该受公司法调整。
2. **内涵不同**
	1. 企业集团包含集团公司，但并非所有集团公司都要成立企业集团。企业集团有两种基本类型，其中从属联合企业集团中的母公司是集团公司，而在协作型联合企业集团中，不存在以谁为核心企业的问题，所有企业是平等关系，在集团的统一管理下活动。在后一种企业集团中，集团成员企业可能都是控股公司，都有自己的若干子公司，这种集团往往是强强联合。
3. **注册方式不同**
	1. 集团公司既可以以自己为核心组成从属型联合企业集团或与其他公司一起组成协作型联合企业集团，也可以仅在母子公司范围内形成公司集团。组成企业集团须批准和登记。但集团公司本身只是履行公司法人登记手续。
4. **组织机构不同**
	1. 企业集团的组织机构由集团章程（集团成员协商一致）决定，而集团公司的组织机构必须在符合公司法规定的条件下由公司章程决定（需经股东会讨论通过）。
5. **管理的原则和依据不同**
	1. 企业集团实行统一管理的原则是经成员企业讨论通过的章程决定的。集团公司是独立公司法人，它自身的经营与运作要符合公司法和其他有关法律的规定；集团公司如果是集团成员，必须履行集团章程规定的权利和义务；集团公司作为从属型联合企业集团中的支配公司，又要承担起集团管理的重任。集团公司与集团利益的协调，与成员企业相互权利义务关系是集团立法和集团协议（章程）要解决的重要问题。
6. **责任和财务制度不同**
	1. 企业集团并不是独立的纳税主体，但要编制合并会计报表。集团的法律后果由集团成员企业负连带责任（集团章程另有约定的除外）。集团公司与其他成员企业一样，独立开展经营活动，是独立的纳税主体。它对其他成员企业除另有约定外，不承担债务责任。
这里需要特别指出的是我国企业集团立法比较滞后。集团的设立、集团成员关系的处理，母子公司的关系，企业集团的管理基本原则，集团的垄断，行政性集团公司等问题都缺乏法律的界定和规范。

### Assets (资产) & Property (财产)
#### Assets (资产)
> 🔗 https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B3%87%E7%94%A2

**资产（英语：Asset**），在会计学上指一企业透过交易或非交易事项所获得之经济资源，能以货币衡量，并预期未来能提供效益者。==资产，就是能够为个人或企业带来收益的东西。==在财务会计中，资产是企业拥有的任何资源，如机器、厂房、商誉、专利等有形资产与无形资产。**一般来说，资产体现了一种所有权，货币可以兑换商品体现了选择权。**

依据资产的一般定义，它具有下述特性：
- 该事物存在未来的经济价值。“未来的经济价值”是指，特定企业（或组织）若拥有该事物（资产），则可以利用其来产生（增加）企业未来的现金流入，或利用其替代（减少）企业未来发生的现金流出。
- 该事物产权被特定企业控制。
- 若某事物属于资产（存在未来的经济价值），但非某企业可控制，则某企业无法利用其经济价值，故该事物对于某企业不属于资产。
- 若该事物属于公共财产，虽然该事物对特定企业可能存在未来的经济价值，但公共财非被特定企业所控制，故公共财皆不为特定企业的资产。

会计学上对资产的分类：
- 依据是否有具体形体分类
	- 有形资产
	- 无形资产
- 依据期限的长短分类
	- 固定资产
	- 流动资产
- 依据资产所有权分类
	- 贷方权益（负债）
	- 所有者权益
#### Property (财产)

==**财产**是指拥有的金钱、物资、房屋、土地等物质财富：国家财产、私人财产，具备金钱价值、并受到法律保护的权利的总称。==大体上，财产有三种，即动产、不动产和知识财产(即 知识产权)。

从哲学上讲，所谓客体是主体的认识行为和实践行为所指向的对象。作为被认识和被实践的对象，客体必须是客观的现实存在，它一经表现出来就不以主体的意志为转移而只能为主体所反映。主体根据自己的实践能力、思维能力以及不断变化的需要，有目的的把行为指向现实的客体。因此，客体是被历史地规范着的。在静态的原初法律关系上，同主体相对应的只能是各种形式的财产，只有财产才是主体对应的客体。但是，由于法律是社会的产物，在普遍存在的动态的法律关系中，法律不仅规范主体对客体的关系，还规范主体与主体之间的关系。**这样，法律所指向的客体就不仅包含财产，还包含主体的行为。** 在现实法律和主体行为的影响之下，纯粹的、静态的、不以人的意志为转移的客观实在被赋予了动态的、社会历史的意义，成为法理意义上的“财产”。

财产的法律含义较为复杂。首先，财产必须是独立于主体之外的客体，当人们说“这是我的财产”时，所指向的必然是实实在在的独立客体。其次，财产这一概念又必须包含主体与客体的关系，即客体为特定主体或全体主体直接或间接控制。如果仅仅说“这是财产”而不强调其归属，那么这种表达在逻辑上是荒谬的，在实践中也是无意义的。事实上，任何人都不享有权利的客体在法律上根本就不是财产。脱离了财产的关系内涵，脱离了主体基于财产而取得的权利，财产这一概念是毫无意义的。因此，**在法律上构成财产必须同时满足两个基本条件：一是财产的客体条件，它必须是独立于或相对独立于主体之外的客体；二是财产的主体条件，它必须是主体享有财产权的客体。**

财产的双重内涵决定了在法治条件下财产的成立必须得到法律的认可。财产作为一种客观存在，很多产生于法律存在之前。没有法律的存在，财产的纯客体内涵，即“物”、“智力成果”之类，并不会自然消亡。但是，当法律与社会生活的各个方面发生联系，成为表达和证明社会关系、调节和保护社会秩序的最紧要手段之后，客观存在的财产能否得到法律的认可，并成为法律意义上的财产就显得极为重要。因为，只有作为客体的财产得到法律认可，财产的关系内涵才能得到法律保障，特定主体对财产的控制也才能成为法律认可的现实。财产法正是确认和保障主体对特定财产的控制和利用关系的法律。“财产法调整人们因物而产生的法律关系。在任何社会中，由于人类结群而居，并为控制和使用相对稀缺的资源而竞争，这些关系的发生也就势所必然。”

**法律对于经其认可的财产关系保护的最基本方式是赋予财产控制者一种法定权利，我们通常称之为财产权。** 允许财产控制者享有和主张这种权利构成了对财产的法律保护，而财产权的权能则说明了这种法律保护的范围与程度。财产的概念与财产权的概念相辅相成，须臾不可分离。没有了财产权，所谓的“财产”只不过是不为任何人控制的“死物”；而没有了财产，财产权就失去了其行使权利的对象，财产权本身也就不可能得以成立。财产权本身只是一种表达“关系”而非表达“事物”的概念，它的双重性在于既表明了主体与客体之间的关系，同时又表明了主体与主体之问的关系。从主体与客体的关系看，财产权表明了主体对客体的控制和利用程度。从主体与主体之间的关系看，财产权表明了法律对稀缺性客体的分配机制和对基于这种分配机制形成的分配结果的保护。

==财产的基本类型==
人类需要的满足是以财产为基础的，财产法是整个法律体系的重要组成部分。由于人类需要的多样性，需要满足手段的多元性，以及最大限度满足人类需要这一目标的决定性，财产的类型也必然是多种多样的。在法律上实行财产类型的划分，是为了更好地总结区别财产的特征，并依据这些特征为满足人类的区别需要，制定出相应的一般性的和抽象性的财产规则，以节约交易成本并为人类生活提给便利。“财产法的紧要目的之一，就是要在这种需要和便利之间谋求调和。”按照财产是否具备实际的客体，可以将财产分为客观财产和主观财产；按照客体本身是否具备物质形态，可以将财产分为有形财产和无形财产；按照这些财产本身的具体形成依据区别，可以将财产分为原生财产和衍生财产。
1. 客观财产与主观财产
2. 有形财产与无形财产
3. 原生财产与衍生财产

#### Wealth (财富)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth

==Wealth is the abundance of valuable financial assets or physical possessions which can be converted into a form that can be used for transactions.== This includes the core meaning as held in the originating Old English word weal, which is from an Indo-European word stem. The modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics, and clearly so for growth economics and development economics, yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent. A person possessing a substantial net worth is known as wealthy. Net worth is defined as the current value of one's assets less liabilities (excluding the principal in trust accounts).

At the most general level, economists may define wealth as "the total of anything of value" that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various people in different contexts. Defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own. A community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy.

==The United Nations definition of **inclusive wealth** is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human, and physical assets.== Natural capital includes land, forests, energy resources, and minerals. Human capital is the population's education and skills. Physical (or "manufactured") capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.

### Production and Capital/ Cap (生产与资本)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)

==In economics, **capital goods** or **capital** are "those durable produced goods that are in turn used as productive inputs for further production" of goods and services==. A typical example is the machinery used in a factory. At the macroeconomic level, "the nation's capital stock includes buildings, equipment, software, and inventories during a given year."

The **means of production** is as a "... series of heterogeneous commodities, each having specific technical characteristics ..." "capital goods", are one of the three types of **[intermediate goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_good)** used in the production process, the other two being **land** and **labour**. The three are also known collectively as "**primary factors of production**". This classification originated during the classical economics period and has remained the dominant method for classification.

Capital can be increased by the use of a production process (see [production function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_function "Production function") and [factors of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production "Factors of production")). ==Outputs of the production process are normally classified as **capital goods**, **durable goods**, and **consumer goods**.== Durable goods are differentiated from capital goods by virtue of the fact that they are long lived personal property not used in the production of marketable goods, e.g personal homes and personal automobiles are not used in the production of marketable goods and services.

==In [Marxian critique of political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxian_critique_of_political_economy "Marxian critique of political economy"), capital is viewed as a social relation.== Critical analysis of the economists portrayal of the capitalist mode of production as a transhistorical state of affairs distinguishes different forms of capital:
- [constant capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_capital "Constant capital"), which refers to capital goods
- [variable capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_capital "Variable capital"), which refers to labor-inputs, where the cost is "variable" based on the amount of wages and salaries paid during an employee's contract/employment,
- [fictitious capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_capital "Fictitious capital"), which refers to intangible representations or abstractions of physical capital, such as stocks, bonds and securities (or "tradable [paper claims to wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_wealth "Paper wealth")")

[Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith") defined capital as "that part of man's stock which he expects to afford him revenue". In economic models, capital is an input in the production function. The total physical capital at any given moment in time is referred to as the capital stock (not to be confused with the capital stock of a business entity). Capital goods, real capital, or capital assets are already-produced, durable goods or any non-financial asset that is used in production of goods or services.

有三种不同类型的成本，分别是可重复使用的生产工具（器械）、消耗品（耗材）、劳动力（人工），他们从不同的维度又可以分成不同的类型。资本是资本家拥有的财富，资本可以作为成本来产生更多的资本。下面这个图可以清楚地概括这一点。这里劳动资料就是器械，劳动对象就是耗材。

劳动对象和劳动资料，是按照它们在劳动过程中所处的地位和所起的作用来区分的，两者可以在一定条件下相互转化。有的东西，在一种场合是劳动资料，在另一种场合是劳动对象。如牛在耕地时是劳动资料，而当它在屠宰场被宰杀时便成了劳动对象
#### Modern Types of Capital
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)

Detailed classifications of capital that have been used in various theoretical or applied uses generally respect the following division:
- [Financial capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_capital "Financial capital"), which represents obligations, and is liquidated as money for trade, and owned by legal entities. It is in the form of capital assets, traded in financial markets. Its market value is not based on the historical accumulation of money invested but on the perception by the market of its expected revenues and of the risk entailed.
- [Social capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital "Social capital"), which in private enterprise is partly captured as [goodwill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwill_\(accounting\) "Goodwill (accounting)") or [brand value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_value "Brand value"), but is a more general concept of inter-relationships between human beings having money-like value that motivates actions in a similar fashion to paid compensation.
- Instructional capital, defined originally in academia as that aspect of teaching and knowledge transfer that is not inherent in individuals or social relationships but transferable. Various theories use names like [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") or [intellectual capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_capital "Intellectual capital") to describe similar concepts but these are not strictly defined as in the academic definition and have no widely agreed accounting treatment.
- [Human capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital "Human capital"), a broad term that generally includes social, instructional and individual human [talent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptitude "Aptitude") in combination. It is used in technical economics to define "balanced growth", which is the goal of improving human capital as much as economic capital.
- [Public capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_capital "Public capital") is a blanket term that attempts to characterize physical capital that is considered [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure "Infrastructure") and which supports production in unclear or poorly accounted ways. This encompasses the aggregate body of all government-owned assets that are used to promote private industry productivity, including highways, railways, airports, water treatment facilities, telecommunications, electric grids, energy utilities, municipal buildings, public hospitals and schools, police, fire protection, courts and still others. However, it is a problematic term insofar as many of these assets can be either publicly or privately owned.
- [Natural or ecological capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_capital "Natural capital") is the world's stock of natural resources, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. Some natural capital assets provide people with free goods and services, often called [ecosystem services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_service "Ecosystem service"). Two of these (clean water and fertile soil) underpin our economy and society and make human life possible.

Separate literatures have developed to describe both [natural capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_capital "Natural capital") and [social capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital "Social capital"). Such terms reflect a wide consensus that nature and society both function in such a similar manner as traditional industrial infrastructural capital, that it is entirely appropriate to refer to them as different types of capital in themselves. In particular, they can be used in the production of other goods, are not used up immediately in the process of production, and can be enhanced (if not created) by human effort.

There is also a literature of [intellectual capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_capital "Intellectual capital") and [intellectual property law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property_law "Intellectual property law"). However, this increasingly distinguishes means of capital investment, and collection of potential rewards for [patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent"), [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright") (creative or [individual capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_capital "Individual capital")), and [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "Trademark") (social trust or social capital) instruments.

Building on Marx, and on the theories of the sociologist and philosopher [Pierre Bourdieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu "Pierre Bourdieu"), scholars have recently argued for the significance of "culinary capital" in the arena of food. The idea is that the production, consumption, and distribution of knowledge about food can confer power and status.
#### Production Capital/ Productive Forces (生产资本/ 生产力)
> TLDR: 劳动者使用劳动资料对劳动对象进行生产活动。它们共同组成生产资本/生产力。

> 🔗 https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E7%94%9F%E4%BA%A7%E5%8A%9B

==生产力（英语：productive forces；德语：Produktivkraft）是改造和影响自然并使之适应社会需要的客观物质力量，是历史唯物主义的核心概念。==

通常认为，生产力有三要素：劳动力、劳动资料、劳动对象。劳动力，或劳动能力，是“人的身体即活的人体中存在的、每当人生产某种使用价值时就运用的体力和智力的总和”。劳动资料也称劳动手段，是劳动过程中所运用的物质资料或物质条件。劳动对象即劳动过程中所能加工的一切对象，包括自然物和加工过的原材料。劳动资料和劳动对象合称生产资料。

马克思指出“由此可见，一定的生产方式或一定的工业阶段始终是与一定的共同活动方式或一定的社会阶段联系着的，而这种共同活动方式本身就是‘生产力’”
##### Labor and Labor Power (劳动与劳动力)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_power

==Labour power (German: Arbeitskraft; French: force de travail) is the capacity to work==, a key concept used by **Karl Marx** in his **critique of capitalist political economy.** Marx distinguished between the ==capacity to do the work, i.e. labour power==, and the ==physical act of working, i.e. labour.== Human labour power exists in any kind of society, but on what terms it is traded or combined with means of production to produce goods and services has historically varied greatly.

The general idea of labour-power had existed previously in classical political economy. Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and David Ricardo's On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation already referred to the "productive powers of labour". However, Marx made the concept much more precise, critically examining the functions of labour-power in production, how labour-power is used, organized and exploited, and how it is typically valued and priced in bourgeois society.

==Under capitalism, according to Marx, the productive powers of labour appear as the creative power of capital.== Indeed, "labour power at work" becomes a component of capital, it functions as working capital. Work becomes just work, workers become an abstract labour force, labour becomes an economic input or a factor of production, and the control over work becomes mainly a management prerogative.
###### Division of Labor
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour

==The **division of labour** is the separation of the tasks in any economic system or organization so that participants may specialize (**specialization**).== Individuals, organizations, and nations are endowed with or acquire specialized capabilities, and either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own. Specialized capabilities may include equipment or natural resources as well as skills. Training and combinations of equipment and other assets acting together are often important. For example, an individual may specialize by acquiring tools and the skills to use them effectively just as an organization may specialize by acquiring specialized equipment and hiring or training skilled operators. **The division of labour is the motive for trade and the source of economic interdependence.**

An increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of total output and trade, the rise of capitalism, and the increasing complexity of industrialized processes. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in ancient **Sumerian (Mesopotamian) culture**, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Division of labour generally also increases both producer and individual worker productivity.
##### Means of Production (生产资料)
> 🔗 https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E7%94%9F%E4%BA%A7%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99

==生产资料（英语：means of production），或称生产手段，是生产产品（如商品或服务）的物（如土地、劳动和资本），包括劳动资料和劳动对象；然而它也可以指全部用来生产产品的东西==。生产工具是基本的劳动资料。它也可以作为“生产和分销资料”的缩写，这个词还包括了通过分销商进行产品的物流分销和分送；或者作为“生产、分配和交换资料”的缩写，这个词进一步包括了通过消费者进行分销产品的交换。

“生产资料”这个概念被各个领域的研究者——包括政治学、经济学和社会学——广泛地用来讨论任何具有生产价值的东西，它们的所有权，以及生产它们所需要的社会成分之间的关系。
###### 劳动资料 /劳动手段
> 🔗 https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%B3%E5%8A%A8%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99

根据马克思主义政治经济学的定义，劳动资料是指人们在生产过程中用于改变或影响劳动对象的形状、性质、位置所需要的一切物质资料和物质条件。它包括设备、工具、容器、检验手段以及厂房、生产用房屋等设施。在劳动资料中，设备等生产工具起决定作用。有些物质资料在生产过程中的地位和作用不是固定不变的，有时作为劳动资料，有时作为劳动对象。
###### 劳动对象
> 🔗 https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%B3%E5%8A%A8%E5%AF%B9%E8%B1%A1

劳动对象是马克思主义政治经济学中的概念，是指劳动本身所作用的客体，比如耕作的土地，纺织的棉花等。劳动对象包括两大类。一是自然界的物质，即未经人类加工过的自然物。一是人类劳动加工过的，用做原材料的产品。

劳动对象是马克思主义理论中**生产力三要素**之一，另两个要素是劳动者和劳动资料。而劳动对象和劳动资料构成生产资料。


### Economic System (经济体制)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system

==An **economic system**, or **economic order**, is a **system of production, resource allocation and distribution of goods and services within a economy**. ==It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision-making processes, and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a given community.

An economic system is a type of social system. The mode of production is a related concept. All economic systems must confront and solve the four fundamental economic problems:
1. **What kinds and quantities of goods shall be produced**: This fundamental economic problem is anchored on the theory of pricing. The theory of pricing, in this context, has to do with the economic decision-making between the production of capital goods and consumer goods in the economy in the face of scarce resources. In this regard, the critical evaluation of the needs of the society based on population distribution in terms of age, sex, occupation, and geography is very pertinent.
2. **How goods shall be produced**: The fundamental problem of how goods shall be produced is largely hinged on the least-cost method of production to be adopted as gainfully peculiar to the economically decided goods and services to be produced. On a broad note, the possible production method includes labor-intensive and capital-intensive methods.
3. **How the output will be distributed**: Production is said to be completed when the goods get to the final consumers. This fundamental problem clogs in the wheel of the chain of economic resources distributions can reduce to the barest minimum and optimize consumers' satisfaction.
4. **When to produce**: Consumer satisfaction is partly a function of seasonal analysis as the forces of demand and supply have a lot to do with time. This fundamental economic problem requires an intensive study of time dynamics and seasonal variation vis-a-vis the satisfaction of consumers' needs. It is noteworthy to state that solutions to these fundamental problems can be determined by the type of economic system.

The study of economic systems includes how these various agencies and institutions are linked to one another, how information flows between them, and the social relations within the system (including property rights and the structure of management). The analysis of economic systems traditionally focused on the dichotomies and comparisons between market economies and planned economies and on the distinctions between capitalism and socialism. Subsequently, the categorization of economic systems expanded to include other topics and models that do not conform to the traditional dichotomy.

Today the dominant form of economic organization at the world level is based on **market-oriented mixed economies**. An economic system can be considered a part of the social system and hierarchically equal to the law system, political system, cultural and so on. There is often a strong correlation between certain ideologies, political systems and certain economic systems (for example, consider the meanings of the term "communism"). Many economic systems overlap each other in various areas (for example, the term "mixed economy" can be argued to include elements from various systems). There are also various mutually exclusive hierarchical categorizations.

- [Industrial economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_economy "Industrial economy")
- [Information economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_economy "Information economy")
#### Main Types of Economic Systems
##### Capitalism Economy
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system#Capitalism

[Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism) generally features the ==private ownership of the means of production (capital) and a market economy for coordination==. Corporate capitalism refers to a capitalist marketplace characterized by the dominance of hierarchical, bureaucratic corporations.

[Mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) was the dominant model in Western Europe from the 16th to 18th century. This encouraged imperialism and colonialism until economic and political changes resulted in global decolonization. Modern capitalism has favored free trade to take advantage of increased efficiency due to national comparative advantage and economies of scale in a larger, more universal market. Some critics have applied the term neo-colonialism to the power imbalance between multi-national corporations operating in a free market vs. seemingly impoverished people in developing countries.
##### Socialist Economy
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system#Capitalism

Socialist economic systems (all of which feature social ownership of the means of production) can be subdivided by their coordinating mechanism (planning and markets) into **planned socialist** and **market socialist systems**. Additionally, socialism can be divided based on their property structures between those that are based on public ownership, worker or consumer cooperatives and common ownership (i.e. non-ownership). **Communism** is a hypothetical stage of socialist development articulated by Karl Marx as "second stage socialism" in  _[Critique of the Gotha Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_the_Gotha_Program "Critique of the Gotha Program")_, whereby the economic output is distributed based on need and not simply on the basis of labor contribution.
##### Mixed Economy
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system#Capitalism

There is no precise definition of a "mixed economy". Theoretically, it may refer to an economic system that combines one of three characteristics: public and private ownership of industry, market-based allocation with economic planning, or free markets with state interventionism.

In practice, "mixed economy" generally refers to market economies with substantial state interventionism and/or sizable [public sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector "Public sector") alongside a dominant [private sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector "Private sector"). Actually, mixed economies gravitate more heavily to one end of the spectrum. Notable economic models and theories that have been described as a "mixed economy" include the following:
- [Georgism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism "Georgism") – socialized rents on land
- [Mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy "Mixed economy") (It can be categorized under many titles)
    - [American School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_School_\(economics\) "American School (economics)")
    - [Developmental state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_state "Developmental state")
    - [Dirigisme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirigisme "Dirigisme") (Government-directed capitalist economy)
    - [Distributism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism "Distributism")
    - [Indicative planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicative_planning "Indicative planning"), also known as a planned market economy
    - [Japanese system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_post-war_economic_miracle "Japanese post-war economic miracle")
    - [Nordic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model "Nordic model") (Social democrat economics of Nordic countries)
    - [Progressive utilization theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_utilization_theory "Progressive utilization theory")
    - [Corporatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism "Corporatism") (economies based on tripartite negotiation between labor, capital, and the state)
    - [Social market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy "Social market economy"), also known as _Soziale Marktwirtschaft_ (Mixed capitalist)
    - [New Economic Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy "New Economic Policy") (Mixed socialist)
    - [State capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism "State capitalism") (Government-dominated capitalist economy)
    - [Socialist Market Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_market_economy "Socialist market economy") (Mixed socialist)

## Economical Indicators
### Price of Goods
#### Price Indices ⭐️
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index

A **price index** (_plural_: "price indices" or "price indexes") is a normalized [average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average "Average") (typically a [weighted average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean "Weighted mean")) of [price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price "Price") relatives for a given class of [goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_\(economics\) "Good (economics)") or [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_\(economics\) "Service (economics)") in a specific region over a defined time period. It is a [statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic "Statistic") designed to measure how these price relatives, as a whole, differ between time periods or geographical locations, often expressed relative to a base period set at 100.

Price indices serve multiple purposes. Broad indices, like the [Consumer price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index "Consumer price index"), reflect the economy’s general [price level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_level "Price level") or [cost of living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living "Cost of living"), while narrower ones, such as the [Producer price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index "Producer price index"), assist producers with pricing and business planning. They can also guide investment decisions by tracking price trends.

Some widely recognized price indices include:
- [Consumer price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index "Consumer price index") – Measures retail price changes for consumer goods and services.
- [Producer price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index "Producer price index") – Tracks wholesale price changes for producers.
- [Wholesale price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesale_price_index "Wholesale price index") – Monitors price changes at the wholesale level (historical in some regions).
- [Employment cost index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_cost_index "Employment cost index") – Gauges changes in labor costs.
- [Export price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Import_and_Export_Price_Indexes "U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes") – Tracks export price trends.
- [Import price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Import_and_Export_Price_Indexes "U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes") – Monitors import price changes.
- [GDP deflator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_deflator "GDP deflator") – Reflects price changes across all goods and services in GDP.
##### CPI (Consumer price index)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index

A **consumer price index** (**CPI**) is a statistical estimate of the level of prices of goods and services bought for consumption purposes by households. It is calculated as the weighted average price of a [market basket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_basket "Market basket") of [consumer goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods "Goods") and [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_\(economics\) "Service (economics)"). Changes in CPI track changes in prices over time. The items in the basket are updated periodically to reflect changes in consumer spending habits. The prices of the goods and services in the basket are collected (often monthly) from a sample of retail and service establishments. The prices are then adjusted for changes in quality or features. Changes in the CPI can be used to track inflation over time and to compare inflation rates between different countries. While the CPI is not a perfect measure of inflation or the [cost of living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living "Cost of living"), it is a useful tool for tracking these economic indicators.  It is one of several [price indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index "Price index") calculated by many national statistical agencies.

[置身事内 | 豆瓣]: https://book.douban.com/subject/35546622/
《置身事内》通俗，略浅。真的要了解中国经济，尤其是政府的角色，还是推荐周黎安《转型中的地方政府》周飞舟《以利为利》还有徐高的《宏观经济学二十五讲》。兰小欢过分强调政府在经济中的作为，我更倾向于自下而上的自发秩序的作用，也更相信经济学包括中国的普适性大于特殊性。不过，综述、引述、拓展阅读都挺有价值。
