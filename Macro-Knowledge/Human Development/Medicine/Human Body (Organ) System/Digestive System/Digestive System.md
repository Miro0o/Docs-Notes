The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tractâ€”also called the GI tract or digestive tractâ€”and theÂ [liver](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/L/liver),Â [pancreas](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/P/pancreas), and gallbladder. TheÂ [GI tract](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/G/gastrointestinal-tract)Â is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to theÂ [anus](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/A/anus). The hollow organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth,Â [esophagus](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/E/esophagus), stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are the solid organs of the digestive system.

The small intestine has three parts. The first part is called the duodenum. The jejunum is in the middle and the ileum is at the end. The large intestine includes theÂ [appendix](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/A/appendix), cecum,Â [colon](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/C/colon), and rectum. The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch attached to the cecum. The cecum is the first part of the large intestine. The colon is next. The rectum is the end of the large intestine.

[Bacteria](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/B/bacteria)Â in your GI tract, also called gut flora or microbiome, help withÂ [digestion](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/D/digestion). Parts of yourÂ [nervous](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/N/nervous-system)Â andÂ [circulatory](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/how-heart-works)Â _NIH external link_Â systems also help. Working together, nerves,Â [hormones](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/H/hormone), bacteria, blood, and the organs of your digestive system digest the foods and liquids you eat or drink each day.
