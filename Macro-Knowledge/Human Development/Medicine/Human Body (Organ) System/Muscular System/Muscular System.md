Anatomy of ExerciseÂ (11 books)
**Anatomy of Exercise**Â is revolutionary for its insights into how different muscles of the body actually work during exercise. The book is organized by body area and shows common sequences in the progression of a typical workout. Lifelike anatomical illustrations demonstrate each exercise and reveal in colorful detail exactly which muscles are engaged, which are being conditioned and how those muscles respond.

The metabolic equivalent of task (MET) is the ratio of the metabolic rate during exercise to the metabolic rate at rest. One MET corresponds to an energy expenditure of 1 kcal/kg/hour. One MET can also be expressed as oxygen uptake of 3.5 ml/kg/min.

METs are used to estimate how many calories are burned during many common physical activities.
