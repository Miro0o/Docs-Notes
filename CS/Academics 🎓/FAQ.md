## ðŸ‘‰ Why do people in academia tend to write their email address with "(dot)", "(at)", instead of ".", "@"?
#email #academia

As others have said, it's to prevent email address harvesting. So why academic users mainly, and why do they use this pathetically ineffective technique?Â 

Academic users were among the first to actually use the web for any purpose. Universities were the first large-scale source of email addresses, and when the web became available, academic users were the first large-scale group to take advantage of it. When spam started to become an issue in the early to mid 1990s, address obfuscation was actually an effective way of preventing address harvesting -- at least, for a few months, or a year or two, before spammers were doing the obvious corrections.Â 

Even after spammers were correcting obfuscations, the early web users often continued to obfuscate: They had already done it and didn't bother changing it back, or they figured it might help and wouldn't hurt, or maybe they copied a template from someone else and just followed it. Again, these early web pages were not reallyÂ _designed_Â as such, they were just some student or early-stage professor hand-coding html. If new web pages are still obfuscating, they're presumably just copying their mentor, or their mentor's mentor, without really thinking much about it.

That's the same reason you see this sort of thing among the other early-adopter classes of web users, like tech folks. People who put out pages in the early 90s had a more or less legitimate reason for it, and the tradition has just hung around.

(I just looked at my web page, first hand-coded with HTML in 1995, to see if I did this, but I don't even see an email address on my page any more. I don't think I ever bothered to obfuscate even when I did include contact links.)
