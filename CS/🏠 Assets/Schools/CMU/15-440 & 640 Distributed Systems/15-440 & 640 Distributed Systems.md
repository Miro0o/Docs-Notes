### Slides from Lectures and Recitations
Will be placed in the course AFS area at: `/afs/andrew/course/15/440/classnotes` soon after each lecture and recitation. If you are authenticated at CMU, you can also access this AFS directory via the “slides” link at the top of this web page. These notes are for your personal use only. Please do not distribute them.


### Textbooks and Optional Readings
There are no required textbooks. Here are four references that go beyond what is taught in class:
- “Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms” by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten Van Steen, Third (2017) Edition, Prentice Hall
- “Guide to Reliable Distributed Systems” by Kenneth P. Birman, Springer
- “Distributed Algorithms” by Nancy Lynch, Elsevier (Imprint: Morgan Kaufman)
- [Foundations of Distributed Consensus and Blockchains](https://www.distributedconsensus.net/) by Elaine Shi (2020, Book manuscript)

In addition, the “Readings” link at the top of this web page has some specifc optional readings that we will mention at different points in the lectures. The pdf’s of these optional readings are available on this course website.



## Intro
15-440 is an introductory course in distributed systems. The emphasis will be on the techniques for creating functional, usable, and scalable distributed systems. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation

The goals of this course are twofold. First, for students to gain an understanding of the principles and techniques behind the design of distributed systems, such as locking, concurrency, caching, prefetching, scheduling, and communication across the network. Second, for students to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems.

The major themes this course will teach include:
- Resource scarcity, scheduling, and concurrency
- Communication latency and bandwidth
- Naming
- Abstraction and modularity
- Imperfect communication and other types of failure
- Protection from accidental and malicious harm
- Optimism
- Consensus
- Use of instrumentation, monitoring, and debugging tools in problem solving.
- Design, implementation, and debugging of substantial programming projects that span the above themes
