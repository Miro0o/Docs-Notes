The Secure, Reliable, and Intelligent Systems Lab (SRI) is a research group in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. Our current research focus is on the areas of reliable, secure, robust and fair machine learning, probabilistic and quantum programming, and machine learning for code. Our work led to three ETH spin-offs: [DeepCode.ai](http://deepcode.ai/) (AI for Code), [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/) (security verification), and [LatticeFlow](https://latticeflow.ai/) (robust machine learning).
