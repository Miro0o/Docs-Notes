| [UCB CS161: Computer Security](https://cs161.org/) | Python, Go, C        | [Completed](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/UCB-CS161) | 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 |

This course is divided into 5 sections:
- Security principles : how to design a secure system
- Memory safety : buffer overflow attack
- Cryptography : symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, MAC, digital signature .........
- Web : SQL, XSS, XSRF .......
- Networking : attacks for each layer

The shining part of the course is the labs and projects, which will greatly enhance your mastery of the knowledge.

- Labs: there are three labs in total
  - padding oracle : how to make use of the padding oracle to breach the block cypher.
  - a real attack : a real problem countered in the CS61A's exam file releasing
  - networking : packet sniffing
- Projects: there are three projects in total
  - Proj1 : Hack into the VM using buffer overflow attacks. You will do real attacks on the providing virtualbox virtual machine.
  - **Proj2 (warning) :** This is a very code-heavy projects. You will implement a secure file sharing system in Go language. [Here is my implementation and design doc.](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/CS161-Project2-SecureFileShareSystem)(I spent three whole days to complete this project, 3k lines of code in total)
  - Proj3 : In this project, you will use what you have learned in web scurity to attack a poorly-implemented website. Unfortunately, this project is only available for the Berkeley's students. However, I found a great website [Hacker101](https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf) which provides similar project.
