### Labs & Communities
https://noduslabs.com/
Nodus Labs does research in communities, communication, and social artefacts through the frameworks of complexity theory and network science.

Our main focus is in research and development of the interfaces for cognitive reconfiguration, which can produce evolution in learning. Those interfaces can be understood in a broad sense: from the actual tools and software to specially designed interactive situations, writings, workshops and events.
