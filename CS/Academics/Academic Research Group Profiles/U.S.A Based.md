At Computer Security Laboratory (SecLab), our mission is to conduct cutting-edge research in computer security, with an emphasis on computer systems and software.   
  
The problems of our interests include: (1) software security (e.g., binary code analysis, rewriting, hardening, and vulnerability discovery such as fuzzing), (2) systems security (e.g., virtualization and container security, side channel analysis with Intel SGX), and (3) security in emerging computing platforms (e.g., mobile, IoT, AI, blockchain, and cloud).   
  
We also offer a number of courses including Operating Systems, Network Security, and Software Security. 

We are (always) looking for self-motivated students with solid systems (e.g., OS, virtualization, compiler, machine code) and networking as well as security background. Interested students who wish to purse a PhD under our direction please drop us an email.
