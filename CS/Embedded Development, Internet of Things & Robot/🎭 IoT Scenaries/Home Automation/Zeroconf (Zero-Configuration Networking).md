Zero-configuration networking (**zeroconf**) is a set of technologies that automatically creates a usable computer network based on the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) when computers or network peripherals are interconnected. It does not require manual operator intervention or special configuration servers. Without zeroconf, a network administrator must set up network services, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS), or configure each computer's network settings manually.

**Zeroconf** is built on three core technologies: 
1. automatic assignment of **numeric network addresses** for networked devices
2. automatic distribution and resolution of **computer hostnames**
3. automatic location of **network services**, such as printing devices.
