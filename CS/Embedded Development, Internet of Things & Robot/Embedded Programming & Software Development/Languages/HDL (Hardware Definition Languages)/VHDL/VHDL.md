## Intro
The second dominant HDL is VHDL, which is an abbreviation for **Very (high-speed integrated circuit) Hardware Design Language.** VHDL came into existence under a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Program Agency (DARPA) contract awarded in 1983 to Intermetrics, IBM, and Texas Instruments. The language was released in August 1985, and it became an IEEE standard in 1987. Its latest revision is IEEE 1097-2002.

VHDL syntax is similar to the **Ada programming language**, which was once the only language authorized for use in any Defense Department projects. VHDL models circuits at a higher level than Verilog. Like Ada, it is a strongly typed language that permits user-defined types. Unlike Verilog, VHDL supports concurrent procedure calls, which are essential for multiprocessor designs.
