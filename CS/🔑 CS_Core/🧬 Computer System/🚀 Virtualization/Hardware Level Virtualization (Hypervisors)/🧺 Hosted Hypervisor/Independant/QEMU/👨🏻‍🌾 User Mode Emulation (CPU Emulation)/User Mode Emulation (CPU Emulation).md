## Intro
> The second supported way to use QEMU isÂ [User Mode Emulation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/user/index.html#user-mode-emulation), where QEMU can launch processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. In this mode the CPU is always emulated.

This section of the manual is the overall guide for users using QEMU for user-mode emulation. In this mode, QEMU can launch processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.
