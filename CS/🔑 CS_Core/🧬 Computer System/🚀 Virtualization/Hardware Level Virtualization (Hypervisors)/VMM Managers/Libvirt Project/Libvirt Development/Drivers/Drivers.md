## Internal drivers
- [Hypervisor drivers](https://libvirt.org/drivers.html#hypervisor-drivers)
- [Storage drivers](https://libvirt.org/storage.html)
- [Node device driver](https://libvirt.org/drvnodedev.html)
- [Secret driver](https://libvirt.org/drvsecret.html)

The libvirt public API delegates its implementation to one or more internal drivers, depending on theÂ [connection URI](https://libvirt.org/uri.html)Â passed when initializing the library. There is always a hypervisor driver active, and if the libvirt daemon is available there will usually be a network and storage driver active.
