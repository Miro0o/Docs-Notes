## Intro
This is aÂ [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)Â plugin that adds aÂ [Libvirt](http://libvirt.org/)Â provider to Vagrant, allowing Vagrant to control and provision machines via Libvirt toolkit.

**Note:**Â Actual version is still a development one. Feedback is welcome and can help a lot :-)
