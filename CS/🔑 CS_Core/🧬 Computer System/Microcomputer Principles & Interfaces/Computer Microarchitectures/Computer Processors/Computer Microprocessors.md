[TOC]



> 💡 The design of a microprocessor (or simple processor) heavily relies on the ↗ [Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)](../../../Computer%20Organization%20&%20Architecture/🗣️%20Instruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA)/Instruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA).md) and ↗ [Computer Microarchitectures](../Computer%20Microarchitectures.md).

> This article gives an overview of some essentials of a microprocessor.
> 
> Though it varies on different computer architectures, the main microprocessor architectures are CPU (a general purpose processors unit), GPU, DSP, or the latest SoC (System on a Chip).
