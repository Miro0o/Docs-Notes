### I/O Design Objective in OS
#### 1️⃣ Generality
> I/O devices are heterogeneous in functionalities

Reduce complexity in I/O management (通用性：降低I/O设备管理复杂度)

↗ [IO Generality (via Abstraction)](IO%20Generality%20(via%20Abstraction)/IO%20Generality%20(via%20Abstraction).md)

> 💡 **Abstraction in Computer Science**
> This is a very common & essential concept through out CS !


#### 2️⃣ Efficiency
> I/O devices are heterogeneous in performance (but usually lower than CPU & memory)

Increase the performance of I/O devices (效率：提高I/O设备的性能)
