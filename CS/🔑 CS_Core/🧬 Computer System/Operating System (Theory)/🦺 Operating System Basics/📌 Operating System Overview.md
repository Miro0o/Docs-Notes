# Operating System Overview

[TOC]



## 🥅 OS Objectives & Functions
An OS is a program that controls the execution of application programs, and acts as an interface between applications and the computer hardware. It can be thought of as having three objectives:

- **Convenience**: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.  
- **Efficiency**: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.
- **Ability to evolve**: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing, and introduction of new system functions without interfering with service.

🤔 As an engineering project, ↗ **[Fault Tolerance](Fault%20Tolerance.md)** is also an eternal objective pursuing by generations of engineers.
