## Overview
Two operating system components are crucial: the **kernel** and the **system programs**
- As the core of the operating system, the kernel performs scheduling, synchronization, memory management, interrupt handling, and it provides security and protection.


### Developments Leading to Modern Operating Systems

The rate of change in the demands on operating systems requires not just modifications and enhancements to existing architectures, but new ways of organizing the OS. A wide range of different approaches and design elements has been tried in both experimental and commercial operating systems, but much of the work fits into the following categories:

- Microkernel architecture
- Multithreading
- Symmetric multiprocessing
- Distributed operating systems
- Object-oriented design
