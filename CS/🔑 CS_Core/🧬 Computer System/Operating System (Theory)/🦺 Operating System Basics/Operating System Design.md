## Developments Leading to Modern Operating Systems

The rate of change in the demands on operating systems requires not just modi- fications and enhancements to existing architectures, but new ways of organizing the OS. A wide range of different approaches and design elements has been tried in both experimental and commercial operating systems, but much of the work fits into the following categories:

- Microkernel architecture
- Multithreading
- Symmetric multiprocessing
- Distributed operating systems
- Object-oriented design
