## Intro



## Address Space From Process Perspective
Linux processes is shown in Figure 1.13. (Other Unix systems use a similar layout.) In Linux, the topmost region of the address space is reserved for code and data in the operating system that is common to all processes. The lower region of the address space holds the code and data defined by the user’s process. Note that addresses in the figure increase from the bottom to the top.

The virtual address space seen by each process consists of a number of well-defined areas, each with a specific purpose. You will learn more about these areas later in the book (CSAPP), but it will be helpful to look briefly at each, starting with the lowest addresses and working our way up:
- **Program code and data.** Code begins at the same fixed address for all processes, followed by data locations that correspond to global C variables. The code and data areas are initialized directly from the contents of an executable object file—in our case, the hello executable. You will learn more about this part of the address space when we study linking and loading in Chapter 7.

- **Heap.** The code and data areas are followed immediately by the run-time heap. Unlike the code and data areas, which are fixed in size once the process begins running, the heap expands and contracts dynamically at run time as a result of calls to C standard library routines such as malloc and free. We will study heaps in detail when we learn about managing virtual memory in Chapter 9.

- **Shared libraries.** Near the middle of the address space is an area that holds the code and data for shared libraries such as the C standard library and the math library. The notion of a shared library is a powerful but somewhat difficult concept. You will learn how they work when we study dynamic linking in Chapter 7.

- **Stack.** At the top of the user’s virtual address space is the user stack that the compiler uses to implement function calls. Like the heap, the user stack expands and contracts dynamically during the execution of the program. In particular, each time we call a function, the stack grows. Each time we return from a function, it contracts. You will learn how the compiler uses the stack in Chapter 3.

- **Kernel virtual memory.** The top region of the address space is reserved for the kernel. Application programs are not allowed to read or write the contents of this area or to directly call functions defined in the kernel code. Instead, they must invoke the kernel to perform these operations.

For virtual memory to work, a sophisticated interaction is required between the hardware and the operating system software, including a hardware translation of every address generated by the processor. The basic idea is to store the contents of a process’s virtual memory on disk and then use the main memory as a cache for the disk.



## Virtual Memory Space From System Perspective
一台PC机中，装有多个存储器芯片，这些存储器芯片从物理连接上看是独立的、不同的器件。从读写属性上看分为两类:随机存储器(RAM)和只读存储器(ROM)。随机存储器可读可写，但必须带电存储，关机后存储的内容丢失; 只读存储器只能读取不能写入，关机后其中的内容不丢失。这些存储器从功能和连接上又可分为以下几类。
- **随机存储器。** 用于存放供CPU 使用的绝大部分程序和数据，主随机存储器一般由两个位置上 的 R A M 组 成 ， 装 在 主板 上的 R A M 和 插 在 扩 展 插 槽 上的 R A M 。
- **装有BIOS(Basic Input /Output System，基本输入/输出系统)的ROM。** BIOS是由主板和各类接又卡(如显卡、网卡等)厂商提供的软件系统，可以通过 它利用该硬件设备进行最基本的输入输出。在主板和某些接又卡上插有存储相应 BIOS的ROM。例如，主板上的ROM中存储着主板的BIOS(通常称为系统BIOS);显卡上的ROM中存储着显卡的BIOS;如果网卡上装有ROM，那其中就可以存储网卡的BIOS。
- **接口卡上的RAM。** 某些接又卡需要对大批量输入、输出数据进行暂时存储，在其上装有 RAM。最 典型的是显示卡上的 RAM， 一般称为显存。显示卡随时将显存中的数据向显示 器上输出。换句话说，我们将需要显示的内容写入显存，就会出现在显示器上。

上述的那些存储器，在物理上是独立的器件，但是在以下两点上相同：
- 都和CPU的总线相连
- CPU 对它们进行读或写的时候都通过控制线发出内存读写命令
这也就是说，CPU 在操控它们的时候，把它们都当作内存来对待，把它们总的看作一个由若干存储单元组成的逻辑存储器，这个逻辑存储器就是我们所说的内存地址空间。
