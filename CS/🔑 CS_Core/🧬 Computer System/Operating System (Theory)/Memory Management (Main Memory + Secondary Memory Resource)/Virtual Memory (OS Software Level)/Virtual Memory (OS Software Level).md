## Intro
The design of the memory management portion of an OS depends on three fundamental areas of choice:
1. Whether or not to use virtual memory techniques (**need hardware support**)
2. The use of paging or segmentation or both (**need hardware support**)
3. The algorithms employed for various aspects of memory management (**OS concerns**)

The choices made in the first two areas depend on the hardware platform available. Thus, earlier UNIX implementations did not provide virtual memory because the processors on which the system ran did not support paging or segmentation. Neither of these techniques is practical without hardware support for address translation and other basic functions.

> Two additional comments about the first two items in the preceding list: 
> 1. First, with the exception of operating systems for some of the older personal computers, such as MS-DOS, and specialized systems, all important operating systems provide virtual memory. 
> 2. Second, pure segmentation systems are becoming increasingly rare. When segmentation is combined with paging, most of the memory management issues confronting the OS designer are in the area of paging.4 Thus, we can concentrate in this section on the issues associated with paging.

The choices related to the third item are the domain of operating system software and are the subject of this section.

### No Final Answers to Memory Management
As we shall see, the task of memory management in a paging environment is fiendishly complex. Furthermore, the performance of any particular set of policies depends on main memory size, the relative speed of main and secondary memory, the size and number of processes competing for resources, and the execution behavior of individual programs. This latter characteristic depends on the nature of the application, the programming language and compiler employed, the style of the programmer who wrote it, and, for an interactive program, the dynamic behavior of the user. Thus, the reader must expect no final answers here or anywhere. For smaller systems, the OS designer should attempt to choose a set of policies that seems ‚Äúgood‚Äù over a wide range of conditions, based on the current state of knowledge. For larger systems, particularly mainframes, the operating system should be equipped with monitoring and control tools that allow the site manager to tune the operating system to get ‚Äúgood‚Äù results based on site conditions.
