> The Unix domain socket facility is a standard component ofÂ [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX "POSIX")Â [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system").


AÂ **Unix domain socket**Â akaÂ **UDS**Â orÂ **IPC socket** is a data communications endpointÂ for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system. It is also referred to by its address familyÂ `AF_UNIX`. Valid socket types in the UNIX domain are:

- `SOCK_STREAM`Â (compare toÂ [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol")) â€“ for a stream-oriented socket
- `SOCK_DGRAM`Â (compare toÂ [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol")) â€“ for a datagram-oriented socket that preserves message boundaries (as on most UNIX implementations, UNIX domain datagram sockets are always reliable and don't reorder datagrams)
- `SOCK_SEQPACKET`Â (compare toÂ [SCTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTP "SCTP")) â€“ for a sequenced-packet socket that is connection-oriented, preserves message boundaries, and delivers messages in the order that they were sent

TheÂ [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API "API")Â for Unix domain sockets is similar to that of anÂ [Internet socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_socket "Internet socket"), but rather than using an underlying network protocol, all communication occurs entirely within the operating systemÂ [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) "Kernel (operating system)"). Unix domain sockets may use the file system as their addressÂ [name space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_space "Name space"). (Some operating systems, likeÂ [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux"), offer additional namespaces.) Processes reference Unix domain sockets as file systemÂ [inodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode "Inode"), so two processes can communicate by opening the same socket.

In addition to sending data, processes may sendÂ [file descriptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor "File descriptor")Â across a Unix domain socket connection using theÂ `sendmsg()`Â andÂ `recvmsg()`Â system calls. This allows the sending processes to grant the receiving process access to a file descriptor for which the receiving process otherwise does not have access.Â This can be used to implement a rudimentary form ofÂ [capability-based security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security "Capability-based security").
