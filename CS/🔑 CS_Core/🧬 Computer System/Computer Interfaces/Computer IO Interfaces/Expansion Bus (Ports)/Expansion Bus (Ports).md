## Intro
Expansion buses, such as ISA, PCI, PCI-X, and AGP (from Chapter 1), allow the CPU to communicate with peripheral devices (such as graphics or sound cards), typically through the use of a board plugged into an expansion slot on the motherboard of a computer. These slots allow the user to expand the features provided by the computer. Because computers have become so compact, many new machines (in particular, laptops) may not come with expansion slots able to accept many cards on the market. Therefore, compact versions of these expansion standards have been developed.

Examples of expansion buses include parallel, serial, PS/2, USB, and FireWire (again, all mentioned in Chapter 1). ==People often refer to these types of buses as ports.==
