## Intro



## Ref
[Are IA64 and SPARC chips RISC or CISC architecture?]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/26570720/16542494

> 1. IA64 is a VLIW architecture, which is different from what most people think of as RISC or CISC. Because IA64 tries to move complexity from the hardware to the compiler, it is more RISC than CISC. SPARC is a RISC architecture.
> 
> 3. The number of pipeline stages is a attribute of theÂ _micro-architecture_Â (implementation), not the architecture. So it varies from design to design. Both the Pentium and Pentium Pro implemented the x86 architecture but have different number of pipe stages.

> 5. You can get the instruction set formats on the Web ([SPARC](http://www.cs.unm.edu/~maccabe/classes/341/labman/node9.html)) ([IA-64](https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDTS08/lectures/doc/IA64.pdf)).
