# RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
RISC is something of a misnomer. It is true that the number of instructions is reduced. However, the main objective of RISC machines is to simplify instructions so they can execute more quickly. Each instruction performs only one operation, they are all the same size, they have only a few different layouts, and all arithmetic operations must be performed between registers (data in memory cannot be used as operands). 

> ðŸ™€ Virtually all new instruction sets (for any architectures) since 1982 have been RISC or some sort of combination of CISC and RISC.
