## LTO (Linear Tape-Open)
### LTO Origins
For many years, manufacturers carefully guarded the technology that went into their tape drives. Tapes made for one brand of tape drive could not be read in another. Sometimes even different models of the same brand of tape drive were incompatible. Realizing that this situation was benefiting no one, **Hewlett-Packard**, **IBM**, and **Seagate** Technologies came together in 1997 to formulate an open specification for a best-of-breed tape format called **Linear Tape-Open**, or simply **LTO**.
