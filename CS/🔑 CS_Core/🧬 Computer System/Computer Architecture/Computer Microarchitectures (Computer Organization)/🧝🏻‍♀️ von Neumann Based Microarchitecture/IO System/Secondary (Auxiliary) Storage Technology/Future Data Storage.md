### Limits of Magnetic Media Memory
These gains have been made possible through advances in several different technologies, including magnetic materials sciences, magneto-optical recording heads, and the invention of more efficient error-correcting codes

#### Suerparamagnetic Limit
As data densities increase, there‚Äôs no getting around the fact that fewer magnetic grains are available within the boundaries of each bit cell. 

The **smallest possible bit cell area** is reached when the thermal properties of the disk cause encoded magnetic grains to spontaneously change their polarity, causing a 1 to change to a 0 or a 0 to a 1. This behavior is called **superparamagnetism**, and the bit density at which it occurs is called the **superparamagnetic limit**. At this writing, the superparamagnetic limit using older disk technology is thought to be between 150GB/in2 and 200GB/in2; with newer technologies, densities of over 600GB/in2 have been reached.

Even if these figures are in error by a few orders of magnitude, it is likely that the greatest increases in magnetic data density have already been achieved. Future exponential gains in data densities will almost certainly be realized by using entirely new storage technologies. With this in mind, research is underway to invent **biological**, **holographic**, or **mechanical** replacements for magnetic disks.


### Storage Space & Addressing
Even using traditional magnetic disks, enterprise-class storage continues to grow in size and complexity. Terabyte-sized storage systems are now commonplace. It is increasingly likely that the storage problem of the future is not in having sufficient capacity, but in **finding** the useful information after the data has been stored. This problem may prove to be the most intractable of all.



## Biological Data Storage
Biological materials can store data in many different ways.

Of course, the **ultimate data storage is found in DNA**, where trillions of different messages can be encoded in a small strand of genetic material. But creating a practical DNA storage device is decades away.

Less ambitious approaches combine **inorganic magnetic materials** (such as iron) with **biologically produced materials** (such as oils or proteins). Successful prototypes have encouraged the expectation that biological materials will be capable of supporting data densities of 1Tb/in2. Mass-produced biological storage devices might be brought to market in the second or third decade of the twenty-first century.



## Holographic Data Storage
Holographic data storage is exciting for a number of reasons:
- Foremost is the enormous data density made possible by the use of a three-dimensional medium. Initial experimental systems provide more than 30GB/in2 with transfer rates of around 1GBps. 
- Holographic data storage is also unique in its ability to provide mass storage that is content addressable. This implies that holographic storage would not necessarily require a directory system as we find on magnetic disks today. All accesses would go directly to where a file is placed, without any need to first consult any file allocation tables.

## Helium Drives
Helium drives are drives filled with helium instead of air, which allows the drive to use less power (up to 23% less) to spin the disks, resulting in less heat being generated. This allows more disks to be housed in the same case, increasing capacity by close to 50%. The resulting reduction in drag on the platters in the disk can drop operating temperatures by 4 to 5 degrees.


## Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR)
Shingled magnetic recording (SMR) is a recording technique that allows for higher density by squeezing tracks together, layering the tracks on a platter on top of one another in a similar fashion to how shingles are put on a roof. Although this allows for a much higher capacity on the same physical media, because the tracks are overlapped, a single write can affect multiple ‚Äúshingles,‚Äù resulting in performance loss. This makes this particular technology best for archival storage where data are not updated regularly and performance is not a critical issue.


## Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices



## Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
**Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)** are among many recent discoveries in the field of **nanotechnology**. As the name suggests, CNTs are a cylindrical form of elemental carbon where the walls of the cylinders are one atom thick. Carbon nanotubes can be made to act like switches, opening and closing to store bits. Scientists have devised a number of different nanotube memory configurations.

With access times measured in the neighborhood of 3ns, CNTs have been billed as a **nonvolatile** replacement for **volatile RAM** as well as a replacement for flash memory. Although not yet in mass production as of this writing, the manufacturability of CNT memories has been demonstrated. It is easy to see that if large-capacity CNT memories can be manufactured economically, they will effectively flatten the storage hierarchy and might all but eliminate the need for at least one level of cache memory in large computer systems.



## Memristor
Like CNTs, **memristor** memories are a type of **nonvolatile RAM**. Memristors are a rather recently discovered electronic component that combines the properties of a resistor with memory. This is to say, the component‚Äôs resistance to current flow can be controlled so that states of ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and ‚Äúlow‚Äù can effectively store data bits. These states of high resistance and low resistance are controlled by the application of certain threshold currents that change the physical properties of the underlying semiconductive materials.

Like CNTs, memristor memories promise to replace flash memory and flatten the storage hierarchy. This goal can be achieved only if large-capacity devices can be manufactured economically.



## üèÅ Big Data...
Corporations and governments are investing tremendous amounts of research money to bring new storage technologies to market. There seems no end to our thirst for data‚Äîaccessible data‚Äîwith which we can infer all kinds of trends and predictions of human behavior, known as big data. Big data, however, is becoming increasingly expensive as terabytes of disk storage spin 24 hours a day, consuming gigawatts of electrical power in the process. Even with billions of investment dollars flowing into these new technologies, the payoff is expected to be even greater‚Äîby orders of magnitude.
