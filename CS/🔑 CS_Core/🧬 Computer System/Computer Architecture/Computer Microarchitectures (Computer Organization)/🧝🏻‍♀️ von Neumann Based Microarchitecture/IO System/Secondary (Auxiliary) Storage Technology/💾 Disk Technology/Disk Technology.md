### Disk Media
#### Magnetic Disk


#### Solid State Disk


#### Optical Disks



## Disk Drives
### 1️⃣ Rigid Disk Drives (HDD, Hard Disk Drive)
#### HDD Structures

- Disk tracks are numbered from the outside edge, starting with zero
- Data blocks resides in the secters.

#### 💨 Performance Metrics
##### 1️⃣ Access Time: Seek Time + Rotational Delay
**Seek time**: the time that it takes for a disk arm to move into position over the desired cylinder

**Rotational delay :** is the time that it takes for the desired sector to move into position beneath the read/write heads.


##### 2️⃣ Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)
**MTTF**: is a statistically-determined value often calculated experimentally, e.g., 300,000 hours. It usually doesn't tell us much about the actual expected life of the disk. Design life is usually more realistic.


#### HDD Characteristics
- Low cost is the major advantage of hard disks
- But their limitations include:
	- Very slow compared to main memory
	- Fragility
	- Moving parts wear out


### 2️⃣ Solid State Drives (SSD)
- ﻿﻿Reductions in memory cost enable the widespread adoption of solid state drives（固态硬盘），SSDs.
	- ﻿﻿SSDs store data in non-volatile flash memory circuits.
	- Flash memory is also found in memory sticks (记忆棒) and MP3 players.


SSD access time is typically 100 times faster than magnetic disk, but slower than RAM by a factor of usually 100,000.
- ﻿﻿The number varies widely among manufacturers and interface methods.

﻿﻿Unlike RAM, flash is block-addressable (like disk drives).
- ﻿﻿The bit cells of flash storage wear out after 30,000 to 1,000,000 updates to a page.
- ﻿﻿Updates are spread over the entire medium through wear leveling (磨损平衡) to prolong the life of the SSD.


#### Enterprise SSDs
﻿﻿Enterprise SSDs must maintain the highest degree of performance and reliability.


#### 💨 Performance Metrics
SSD specifications share many common metrics with HDDs.

The Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC) sets standards for SSD performance and reliability metrics. The most important are:

##### 1️⃣ Unrecoverable Bit Error Ratio (UBER)
UBER is a measure of **disk reliability** 
UBER is calculated by dividing the number of data errors by the number of bits read, using a simulated lifetime workload.


##### 2️⃣ Terabyte Written (TBW)
TBW is a measure of **disk endurance (service life)**
TBW is the number of terabytes that can be written to the disk before the disk fails to meet specifications for speed and error rates.
