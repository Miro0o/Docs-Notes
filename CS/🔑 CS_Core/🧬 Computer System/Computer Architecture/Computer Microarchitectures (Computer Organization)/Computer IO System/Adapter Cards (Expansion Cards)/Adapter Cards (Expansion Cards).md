## Intro
In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), an **expansion card** (also called an **expansion board**, **adapter card**, **peripheral card** or **accessory card**) is a [printed circuit board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board "Printed circuit board") that can be inserted into an [electrical connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_connector "Electrical connector"), or **expansion slot** (also referred to as a bus slot) on a computer's [motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard "Motherboard") (see also [backplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane "Backplane")) to add functionality to a computer system. Sometimes the design of the computer's case and motherboard involves placing most (or all) of these slots onto a separate, removable card. Typically such cards are referred to as a [riser card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riser_card "Riser card") in part because they project upward from the board and allow expansion cards to be placed above and parallel to the motherboard.

Expansion cards allow the capabilities and interfaces of a computer system to be extended or supplemented in a way appropriate to the tasks it will perform. For example, a high-speed multi-channel data acquisition system would be of no use in a personal computer used for bookkeeping, but might be a key part of a system used for industrial process control. Expansion cards can often be installed or removed in the field, allowing a degree of user customization for particular purposes. Some expansion cards take the form of "daughterboards" that plug into connectors on a supporting system board.
