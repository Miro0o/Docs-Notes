## Intro
> 💡 The design of a microprocessor (or simple processor) heavily relies on the ↗ [Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)](../../../Instruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA)/Instruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA).md) and ↗ [Computer Microarchitectures (Computer Organization)](../../Computer%20Microarchitectures%20(Computer%20Organization).md).
> 
> This article gives an overview of some essentials of a microprocessor.
> 
> Though it varies on different computer architectures, the main microprocessor architectures are CPU (a general purpose processors unit), GPU, DSP, or the latest SoC (System on a Chip).

### GPU
#### TPU
> 🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/general/221800
> 
> - **Tensor Processing Unit abbreviation TPU** is a custom-built integrated circuit developed specifically for machine learning and tailored for TensorFlow, Google's open-source machine learning framework. TPU’s have been powering Google data centers since 2015, however Google still uses CPUs and GPUs for other types of machine learning.  
> - TPU can handle **upto 128000 operations** per cycle  
> - A co-processor designed to accelerate deep learning tasks develop using TensorFlow (a programming framework); Compilers have not been developed for TPU which could be used for general purpose programming; hence, it requires significant effort to do general programming on TPU

### DSP
A **digital signal processor** (**DSP**) is a specialized microprocessor chip, with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of [digital signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing "Digital signal processing").

DSPs are fabricated on [MOS integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") chips.

DSPs are widely used in [audio signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_processing "Audio signal processing"), [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications "Telecommunications"), [digital image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing "Digital image processing"), [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar"), [sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar "Sonar")and [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition") systems, and in common [consumer electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronic "Consumer electronic") devices such as [mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones "Mobile phones"), [disk drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_drives "Disk drives") and [high-definition television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television "High-definition television") (HDTV) products.
