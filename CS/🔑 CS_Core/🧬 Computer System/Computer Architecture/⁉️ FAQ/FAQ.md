## 👉 X86 Evolution
#x86 #x86_64 #IA-64

Different CPU uses different CIS. Popular ones now are x86 and ARM.

**x86**: Itel's CPU series based on 8086. From 8086(16bit) to IA-32(32bit) to x86-64(64bit)

**IA-64**: Itel's another CPU articheture different from x86. Now was obsolete. 

> History:
>
> While Intel was the first to come up with 64-bit processor (IA-64), AMD was the first to push 64-bit processor to Domestic use and gained huge success. When Intel realized it was legend-behind, it had no choice but to go along with AMD's architecture issuing x86-64 rather than continuing its own IA-64. 

**[ARM](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/ARM架構)**: Advanced RISC Machine. Developed by [Acorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers), British. (Now merged into [Softbank Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group))
