**Universal Serial Bus** (**USB**) is an industry standard that specifies the physical interfaces and protocols for connecting, data transferring and powering of hosts, such as [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), [peripherals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral "Peripheral"), e.g. keyboards and mobile devices, and intermediate hubs.

As of 2023, USB consists of four generations of specifications: [USB 1.‘‘x’’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#USB_1.x), [USB 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#USB_2.0), [USB 3.‘‘x’’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0 "USB 3.0"), and [USB4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB4 "USB4"). Since USB4 the specification enhances the data transfer and power supply functionality with connection-oriented, tunneling architecture designed to combine multiple protocols onto a single physical interface, so that the total speed and performance of the USB4 Fabric can be dynamically shared.

USB connector interfaces are classified into three types: A (host), B (peripheral), and C (2014, replaces A and B). The A and B types know different sizes: Standard, Mini, and Micro. The standard size is the largest and is mainly used for desktop and larger peripheral equipment. The mini size was introduced for mobile devices, but it was replaced by the thinner micro size. The micro size is nowadays the most common for smartphones and tablets. The [USB Type-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Type-C "USB Type-C") connector interface is the newest and the only one applicable to USB4. It is reversible and _can_ support various functionalities and protocols; some are mandatory, many just optional, and depending on the type of the device: host, peripheral device, or hub.
