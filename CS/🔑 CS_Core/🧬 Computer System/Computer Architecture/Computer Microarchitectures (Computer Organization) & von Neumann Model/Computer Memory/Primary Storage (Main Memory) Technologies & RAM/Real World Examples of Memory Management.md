## Intro
- ﻿﻿The Pentium architecture supports both paging and segmentation, and they can be used in various combinations including unpaged unsegmented, segmented unpaged, and unsegmented paged.
- ﻿﻿The processor supports two levels of cache (L1 and L2), both having a block size of 32 bytes.
- ﻿﻿The L1 cache is next to the processor, and the L2 cache sits between the processor and memory.
- ﻿﻿The L1 cache is in two parts: an instruction cache (I-cache) and a data cache (D-cache).
