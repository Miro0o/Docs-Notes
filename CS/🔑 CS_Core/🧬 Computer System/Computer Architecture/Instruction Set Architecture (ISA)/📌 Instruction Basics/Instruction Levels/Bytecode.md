**Bytecode**Â (also calledÂ **portable code**Â orÂ **p-code** is a form ofÂ [instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set "Instruction set")Â designed for efficient execution by a softwareÂ [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing) "Interpreter (computing)"). UnlikeÂ [human-readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable_code "Human-readable code") [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code"), bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result ofÂ [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler")Â parsing and performingÂ [semantic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_analysis_(compilers) "Semantic analysis (compilers)")Â of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.

The name bytecode stems from instruction sets that have one-[byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "Byte")Â [opcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode "Opcode")followed by optional parameters.Â [Intermediate representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation "Intermediate representation")Â such as bytecode may be output byÂ [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language")Â implementations to easeÂ [interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computer_software) "Interpreter (computer software)"), or it may be used to reduce hardware andÂ [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system")Â dependence by allowing the same code to runÂ [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform "Cross-platform"), on different devices. Bytecode may often be either directly executed on aÂ [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine "Virtual machine")Â (aÂ [p-code machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine "P-code machine"), i.e., interpreter), or it may be further compiled intoÂ [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code")Â for better performance.

Since bytecode instructions are processed by software, they may be arbitrarily complex, but are nonetheless often akin to traditional hardware instructions: virtualÂ [stack machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine "Stack machine")Â are the most common, but virtualÂ [register machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine "Register machine")Â have been built also.Â Different parts may often be stored in separate files, similar toÂ [object modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file "Object file"), but dynamically loaded during execution.
