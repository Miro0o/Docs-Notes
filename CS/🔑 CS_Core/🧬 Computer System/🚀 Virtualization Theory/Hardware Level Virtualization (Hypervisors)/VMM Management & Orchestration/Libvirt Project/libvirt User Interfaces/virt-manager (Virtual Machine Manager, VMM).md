## Intro
> The virt-manager source contains not only virt-manager itself but also a collection of further helpful tools like virt-install, virt-clone and virt-viewer.

Virtual Machine Manager allows users to:
- create, edit, start and stop VMs
- view and control each VM's console
- see performance and utilization statistics for each VM
- view all running VMs and hosts, and their live performance or resource utilization statistics.
- use [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine "Kernel-based Virtual Machine"), [Xen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen "Xen") or [QEMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU "QEMU") virtual machines, running either locally or remotely.
- use [LXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC "LXC") [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization "Operating-system-level virtualization")

Support for [FreeBSD's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD") [bhyve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhyve "Bhyve") hypervisor has been included since 2014, though it remains disabled by default
