memory size translation 
32 bit address, has memory of 16 1M \* 8 , how many bits is needed to address the memory

xxxxxxxx 8 bit instructions
\-- xxx xxx 2 3-bit oprand
\---- xxxx 1 4-bit oprand
\----- xxx 1 3-bit oprand
key is order cannot overlap

e.g. 
if (10 xxx xxx ) is assigned, 
then (10 11 xxxx) is not assignable. 
because (10) is overlapped
