Processors Control the operation of the computer and performs its data processing functions. 

Term "microprocessor" refers to a single implemented  processor and, very often, when there are more than one microprocessors the processors unit is referred to as the central processing unit (CPU).

ðŸ‘€ This section only focus on processor implementation under von Neumann based microarchitecture.
