Processors Control the operation of the computer and perform its data processing functions. 

The term "microprocessor" refers to a single implemented processor and, very often, when there are more than one microprocessor the processor's unit is referred to as the central processing unit (CPU).

ðŸ‘€ This section only focuses on processor implementation under von Neumann-based microarchitecture.
