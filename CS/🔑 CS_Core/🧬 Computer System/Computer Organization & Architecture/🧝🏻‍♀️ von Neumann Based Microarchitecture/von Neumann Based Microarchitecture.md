Today’s version of the **stored-program machine architecture** (**von Neumann Based Models or Princton Models**) satisfies at least the following characteristics:

1. Consists of three hardware systems: 
	1. a central processing unit (CPU) with 
		1. a 1️⃣ **control unit**;
		2. an 2️⃣ **arithmetic logic unit (ALU)**;
		3. registers (small storage areas);
		4. a program counter; 
	2. a 3️⃣ **main memory system**, which holds programs that control the computer’s operation; 
	3. an 4️⃣5️⃣ **I/O system**.

3. Has the capacity to carry out **sequential instruction processing**.

4. Contains a **single path (bus system)**, either physically or logically, between the main memory system and the control unit of the CPU, forcing alternation of instruction and execution cycles. This single path is often referred to as the ==von Neumann bottleneck==.
