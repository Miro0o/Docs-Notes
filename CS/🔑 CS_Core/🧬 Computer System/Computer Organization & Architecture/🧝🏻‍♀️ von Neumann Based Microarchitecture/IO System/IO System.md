## I/O and Performance
### Amdahl's Law
In 1967, Gene Amdahl recognized the interrelationship of all components with the overall efficiency of a computer system. He quantified his observations in a formula, which is now known as **Amdahl‚Äôs Law**. In essence, Amdahl‚Äôs Law states that ==the overall speedup of a computer system depends on both the speedup in a particular component and how much that component is used by the system.== In symbols:
$$S = \frac{1}{(1-f)+(f/k)}$$

where
- S is the **overall system speedup**;  
- f is the **fraction of work** performed by the faster component;
- k is the **speedup of a new component**.

#### Different Expressions of 'Speed-up'



## I/O Architectures
We will define input/output as a subsystem of components that moves coded data between external devices and a host system, consisting of a CPU and main memory. I/O subsystems include but are not limited to:
- **Blocks of main memory** that are devoted to I/O functions  
- **Buses** that provide the means of moving data into and out of the system
- **Control modules** in the host and in peripheral devices  
- **Interfaces** to external components such as keyboards and disks  
- **Cabling or communications links** between the host system and its peripherals.

### I/O Protocols
The exact form and meaning of the signals exchanged between a sender and a receiver is called a **protocol**.
Protocols include
- **command signals**, such as ‚ÄúPrinter reset‚Äù;
- **status signals**, such as ‚ÄúTape ready‚Äù; 
- or **data-passing signals**, such as ‚ÄúHere are the bytes you requested.‚Äù

In most data-exchanging protocols, the receiver must acknowledge the commands and data sent to it or indicate that it is ready to receive data. This type of protocol exchange is called a **handshake**.

### Types of I/O
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Character I/O
**Keyboard Input**
Pressing a key on a computer keyboard sets in motion a sequence of activities that process the keystroke as a single event (no matter how fast you type!). The reason for this is found within the mechanics of the keyboard. Each key controls a small switch that closes a connection in a matrix of conductors that runs horizontally and vertically beneath the keys. When a key switch closes, a distinct **scan code** is read by the keyboard circuitry. The scan code is then passed to a **serial interface circuit**, which translates the scan code into a **character code**. The interface places the character code in a keyboard buffer that is maintained in low memory. Immediately afterward, an **I/O interrupt signal** is raised. The characters wait patiently in the buffer until they are retrieved -- one at a time -- by a program (or until the buffer is reset). The keyboard circuits are able to process a new keystroke only after the old one is on its way to the buffer. Although it is certainly possible to press two keys at once, only one of the strokes can be processed at a time.

Because of the random, sequential nature of character I/O as just described, it is best handled through **interrupt-driven I/O processing**.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Block I/O
**Storage I/O**
Magnetic disks and tapes store data in blocks. Consequently, it makes sense to manage disk and tape I/O in block units. 

Blocks can be different sizes, depending on the particular hardware, software, and applications involved. Determining an ideal block size can be an important activity when a system is being tuned for optimum performance. 
- High-performance systems handle large blocks more efficiently than they handle small blocks. 
- Slower systems should manage bytes in smaller blocks; otherwise, the system may become unresponsive to user input during I/O.

Block I/O lends itself to **DMA** or **channel I/O processing**.
