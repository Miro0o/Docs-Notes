## Intro
Optical storage systems offer (practically) unlimited data storage at a cost that is competitive with tape. 

Optical disks come in a number of formats
- the most popular format being the ubiquitous **CD-ROM (compact disc read-only memory)**, which can hold more than 0.5GB of data. CD-ROMs are a read-only medium, making them ideal for software and data distribution. 
- **CD-R (CD recordable)**, **CD-RW (CD rewritable)**, and **WORM (write once read many)** disks are optical storage devices often used for long-term data archiving and high-volume data output. 
	- CD-R and WORM offer unlimited quantities of tamper-resistant storage for documents and data. 
- For long-term archival storage of data, some computer systems send output directly to optical storage rather than paper or microfiche. This is called **computer output to laser disc (COLD)**. 
- Robotic storage libraries called **optical jukeboxes** provide direct access to myriad optical disks. Jukeboxes can store dozens to hundreds of disks, for total capacities of 50GB to 1,200GB and beyond.

Proponents of optical storage claim that optical disks, unlike magnetic media, can be stored for 100 years without noticeable degradation. (Who could possibly challenge this claim?)

Digital versatile discs, or DVDs (formerly called digital video discs), can be thought of as quad-density CDs
