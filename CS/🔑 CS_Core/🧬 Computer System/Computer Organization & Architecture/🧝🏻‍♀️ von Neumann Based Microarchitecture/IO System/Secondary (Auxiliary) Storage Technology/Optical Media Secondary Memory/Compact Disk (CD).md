## VCD (Video CD)
**Video CD** (abbreviated as **VCD**, and also known as **Compact Disc Digital Video**) is a [home video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_video "Home video") format and the first format for distributing films on standard 120 mm (4.7 in) optical discs. 

> The format was widely adopted in Southeast Asia, South Asia, China, Hong Kong, Central Asia and the Middle East, superseding the [VHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS "VHS") and [Betamax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax "Betamax") systems in the regions until [DVD-Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video "DVD-Video") finally became affordable in the first decade of the 21st century.

The format is a standard **digital data format** for storing video on a compact disc. 
- VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players and widely playable in most DVD players, personal computers and some video game console.
- However, they are less playable in most Blu-ray Disc players, vehicle audio with DVD/Blu-ray support and video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Xbox due to lack of [backward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility") for the older [MPEG-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1 "MPEG-1") format, inability to read MPEG-1 in [.dat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dat ".dat") files alongside MPEG-1 in standard MPEG-1, AVI, and Matroska files, or inability to read [CD-ROM XA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM_XA "CD-ROM XA") discs. Some Laserdisc players that were released in the late 90s support VCD as well.

The Video CD standard was created in 1993 by [Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony "Sony"), [Philips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips "Philips"), [Matsushita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panasonic "Panasonic") and [JVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JVC "JVC"); it is referred to as the [White Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Book_(CD_standard) "White Book (CD standard)") standard. The MPEG-1 format was also released that same year.

Although they have been superseded by other media, as of 2022, VCDs continue to be retailed as a low-cost video format in developing territories, such as Africa and parts of Asia.
