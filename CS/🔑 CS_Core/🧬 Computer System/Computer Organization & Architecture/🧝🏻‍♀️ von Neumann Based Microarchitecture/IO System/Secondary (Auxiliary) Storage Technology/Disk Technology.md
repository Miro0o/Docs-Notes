## Intro

## Disk Structure
### Magnetic Disk


### Solid State Disk


### Optical Disks



## Disk Drives
### Rigid Disk Drives (HDD, Hard Disk Drive)

#### Performance Metrics
##### Access Time: Seek Time + Rotational Delay

**Seek time**:

**Rotational delay** 

##### Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)

#### Characteristics
- Low cost is the major advantage of hard disks
- But their limitations include:
	- Very slow compared to main memory
	- Fragility
	- Moving parats wear out



### Solid State Drives (SSD)

#### Enterprise SSDs


#### Performance Metrics
##### Unrecoverable Bit Error Ratio (UBER)
UBER is a measure of disk reliability 
UBER is calculated bu dividing the number of data errors by the number of bits read, using a simulated lifetime workload.


##### Terabytese Written (TBW)
TBW is a measure of disk endurance (service life)
TBW is the number of terabytes that can be written to the disk before the disk fails to meet specifications for speed and error rates.
