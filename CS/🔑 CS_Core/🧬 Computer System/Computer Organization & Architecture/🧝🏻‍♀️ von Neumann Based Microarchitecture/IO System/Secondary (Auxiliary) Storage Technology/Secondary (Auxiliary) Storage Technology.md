## Intro
**Computer data storage** is a technology consisting of [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") components and [recording media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage "Data storage") that are used to retain digital [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing) "Data (computing)"). It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.: 15–16 

The [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing computations. In practice, almost all computers use a [storage hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy "Memory hierarchy"),: 468–473  which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but less expensive and larger options further away. Generally, the fast technologies are referred to as "memory", while slower persistent technologies are referred to as "storage".

Even the first computer designs, [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage "Charles Babbage")'s [Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine "Analytical Engine") and [Percy Ludgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Ludgate "Percy Ludgate")'s Analytical Machine, clearly distinguished between processing and memory (Babbage stored numbers as rotations of gears, while Ludgate stored numbers as displacements of rods in shuttles). This distinction was extended in the [Von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture "Von Neumann architecture"), where the CPU consists of two main parts: The [control unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_unit "Control unit") and the [arithmetic logic unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit "Arithmetic logic unit") (ALU). The former controls the flow of data between the CPU and memory, while the latter performs arithmetic and [logical operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation "Bitwise operation") on data.
