# Virutal Paging

## Intro
> üí° The success of paging, like that of cache, is dependent on the locality principle.

The term virtual memory is usually associated with systems that employ paging, although virtual memory based on segmentation is also used and will be discussed next. The use of paging to achieve virtual memory was first reported for the Atlas computer [KILB62] and soon came into widespread commercial use. Recall from ‚Üó [Simple Paging & Segmentation](../../../../Operating%20System%20(Theory)/Memory%20Management%20(Main%20Memory%20+%20Secondary%20Memory%20Resource)/Simple%20Paging%20&%20Segmentation/Simple%20Paging%20&%20Segmentation.md) that with simple paging, main memory is divided into a number of equalsize frames. Each process is divided into a number of equal-size pages of the same length as frames. A process is loaded by loading all of its pages into available, not necessarily contiguous, frames. With virtual memory paging, we again have equal-size pages of the same length as frames; however, NOT ALL pages need to be loaded into main memory frames for execution.

> The basic idea behind paging is quite simple: Allocate physical memory to processes in **fixed-size chunks (page frames)** and keep track of where the various pages of the process reside by recording information in a **page table**.

==Every process has its own page table==, which typically resides in main memory; the page table stores the physical location of each virtual page of the process.

#### Virtual Page Address Format

#### Virtual Page Address Translation
The basic mechanism for reading a word from memory involves the **translation** of a virtual, or logical, address, consisting of page number and offset, into a physical address, consisting of frame number and offset, using a page table. Because the page table is of variable length, depending on the size of the process, we cannot expect to hold it in registers. Instead, it must be in main memory to be accessed. Figure 8.2 suggests a hardware implementation. When a particular process is running, a register holds the starting address of the page table for that process. The page number of a virtual address is used to index that table and look up the corresponding frame number. This is combined with the offset portion of the virtual address to produce the desired real address. Typically, the page number field is longer than the frame number field. This inequality results from the fact that the number of pages in a process may exceed the number of frames in main memory.

### Page Table Structure
#### Basic Fields in Page Table
The **page table** has N rows, where N is the number of virtual pages in the process. Each **page table entry (PTE)** contains the **frame number** of the corresponding page in main memory. If there are pages of the process currently not in main memory, the page table indicates this by setting a **valid bit** to 0; if the page is in main memory, the valid bit is set to 1. Therefore, each entry of the page table has two fields: a valid bit and a frame number.


#### Additional Fields in Virutal Paging Systems
A page table is also needed for a virtual memory scheme based on paging. Again, it is typical to associate a unique page table with each process.  In this case, however, the page table entries become more complex. 

1Ô∏è‚É£ For example, a **dirty bit** (or a **modify bit**) could be added to indicate whether the page has been changed. This makes returning the page to disk more efficient, because if it is not modified, it does not need to be rewritten to disk.

> Because only some of the pages of a process may be in main memory, a bit is needed in each page table entry to indicate whether the corresponding page is **present (P)** in main memory or not. If the bit indicates that the page is in memory, then the entry also includes the frame number of that page.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Another bit (the **usage bit**) can be added to indicate the page usage. This bit is set to 1 whenever the page is accessed. After a certain time period, the usage bit is set to 0. If the page is referenced again, the usage bit is set to 1. However, if the bit remains 0, this indicates that the page has not been used for a period of time, and the system might benefit by sending this page out to disk.

> The page table entry includes a **modify (M)** bit, indicating whether the contents of the corresponding page have been altered since the page was last loaded into main memory. If there has been no change, then it is not necessary to write the page out when it comes time to replace the page in the frame that it currently occupies. Other control bits may also be present. For example, if protection or sharing is managed at the page level, then bits for that purpose will be required.

By doing so, the system frees up this page‚Äôs location for another page that the process eventually needs (we discuss this in more detail when we introduce replacement algorithms).


### Paging EAT



## ü™ú Page Table Hierachy
In most systems, there is one page table per process. But each process can occupy huge amounts of virtual memory. For example, in the VAX (Virtual Address Extension) architecture, each process can have up to 231 = 2 GB of virtual memory. Using 29 = 512@byte pages means that as many as 222 page table entries are required per process. Clearly, the amount of memory devoted to page tables alone could be unacceptably high. To overcome this problem, most virtual memory schemes store page tables in virtual memory rather than real memory. This means page tables are subject to paging just as other pages are. When a process is running, at least a part of its page table must be in main memory, including the page table entry of the cur- rently executing page. Some processors make use of a two-level scheme to organize large page tables. In this scheme, there is a page directory, in which each entry points to a page table. Thus, if the number of entries in the page directory is X, and if the maximum number of entries in a page table is Y, then a process can consist of up to X * Y pages. Typically, the maximum length of a page table is restricted to be equal to one page. For example, the Pentium processor uses this approach.

Figure 8.3 shows an example of a two-level scheme typical for use with a 32-bit address. If we assume byte-level addressing and 4-kB (212) pages, then the 4-GB (232) virtual address space is composed of 220 pages. If each of these pages is mapped by a 4-byte page table entry, we can create a user page table composed of 220 PTEs requiring 4 MB (222). This huge user page table, occupying 210 pages, can be kept in virtual memory and mapped by a root page table with 210 PTEs occupying 4 kB (212) of main memory. Figure 8.4 shows the steps involved in address translation for this scheme. The root page always remains in main memory. The first 10 bits of a virtual address are used to index into the root page to find a PTE for a page of the user page table. If that page is not in main memory, a page fault occurs. If that page is in main memory, then the next 10 bits of the virtual address index into the user PTE page to find the PTE for the page that is referenced by the virtual address.

## TLB (Translation Look-aside Buffer)
We can speed up the page table lookup by storing the most recent page lookup values in a page table cache called a **tanslation look-aside buffer (TLB)**. Each TLB entry consists of a virtual page number and its corresponding frame number.


Typically, the TLB is implemented as associative cache, and the virtual page/frame pairs can be mapped anywhere. Here are the steps necessary for an address lookup when using a TLB.

## üÜö Pros & Cons of Paging
### Paging Cons
1Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual memory implemented through paging adds an extra memory reference when accessing data. This time penalty is partially alleviated by using a TLB to cache page table entries. However, even with a high hit ratio in the TLB, this process still incurs translation overhead.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Another disadvantage of virtual memory and paging is the extra resource consumption (the memory overhead for storing page tables). In extreme cases (very large programs), the page tables may take up a significant portion of physical memory. One solution offered for this latter problem is to page the page tables, which can get very confusing indeed!

3Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual memory and paging also require special hardware and operating system support.


### Paging Pros
1Ô∏è‚É£ Programs are no longer restricted by the amount of physical memory that is available. Virtual memory permits us to run individual programs whose virtual address space is larger than physical memory. (In effect, this allows one process to share physical memory with itself.) This makes it much easier to write programs because the programmer no longer has to worry about the physical address space limitations.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Because each program requires less physical memory, virtual memory also permits us to run more programs at the same time. This allows us to share the machine among processes whose total address space sizes exceed the physical memory size, resulting in an increase in CPU utilization and system throughput.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The fixed size of frames and pages simplifies both allocation and placement from the perspective of the operating system. Paging also allows the operating system to specify protection (‚Äúthis page belongs to User X and you can‚Äôt access it‚Äù) and sharing (‚Äúthis page belongs to User X but you can read it‚Äù) on a per-page basis.
