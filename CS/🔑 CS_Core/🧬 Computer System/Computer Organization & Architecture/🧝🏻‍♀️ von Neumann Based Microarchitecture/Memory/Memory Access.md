## 🆚 Instructions and Data
↗ [Data Representations & Storage in CS](../../../😤%20Number,%20Data%20and%20Math%20in%20Digital%20Systems/Data%20Representations%20&%20Storage%20in%20CS.md)
↗ [Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)](../../🗣️%20Instruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA)/Instruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA).md)

Instructions and Data are all values stored in memory. It depends on the CPU to interpret them as what they meant to be useful. 
Flow links above to dive deep, including how they are formatted, how they are accessed and more.



## Memory Addressing
> ↗ [ISA Basics /Addressing](../../🗣️%20Instruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA)/📌%20ISA%20Basics/Addressing.md)

Byte Addressable 
Byte Unit /Address Unit (in most modern computers the address unit equates to byte unit for compatibility reasons)

Word Addressable
Word Unit /Memory Unit

Memory Interleaving
high-order interleaving
low-order interleaving

Addressing Modes
Direct Addressing 
Indirect Addressing
