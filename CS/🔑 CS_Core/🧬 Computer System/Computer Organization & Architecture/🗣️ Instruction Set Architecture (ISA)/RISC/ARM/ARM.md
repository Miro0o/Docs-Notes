## Intro
ARM stands for "**Avanced RISC Machine**".

ARM is a family of RISC-like (reduced instruction set computer) ==processor cores found in many portable devices today==. In fact, it is the most widely used 32-bit instruction architecture, found in more than 95% of smartphones, 80% of digital cameras, and more than 40% of all digital television sets.

Founded in 1990, ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) was originally funded by **Apple**, **Acorn**, and **VLSI** and is now licensed by ARM Holdings in Britain. ==ARM Holdings does not manufacture these processors; it sells the licenses, and the cores are developed independently by companies that have an architectural license from ARM.== This allows developers to extend the chip in any way that best fits their needs.

The ARM processor has three architectural profiles, or series: 
1. **Cortex-A** (designed for full operating systems in third-party applications);
2. **Cortex-R** (designed for embedded and real-time applications);
3. **Cortex-M** (designed for microcontroller situations).

Implementations for ARM processors vary significantly. For example, many of these processors use a standard von Neumann architecture, such as the ARM7, whereas others use a Harvard architecture, like the ARM9.
