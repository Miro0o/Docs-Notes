## Intro
MIPS stands for **Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages**.

The MIPS family of CPUs has been one of the most successful and flexible designs of its class. The MIPS R3000, R4000, R5000, R8000, and R10000 are some of the many registered trademarks belonging to MIPS Technologies, Inc.

MIPS chips are used in embedded systems, in addition to computers (such as Silicon Graphics machines) and various computerized toys (Nintendo and Sony use the MIPS CPU in many of their products). Cisco, a very successful manufacturer of internet routers, uses MIPS CPUs as well.
