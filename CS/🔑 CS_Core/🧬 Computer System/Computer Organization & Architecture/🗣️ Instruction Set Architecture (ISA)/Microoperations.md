> 👉 quick look at [👧🏽 MARIE](../../Computer%20Microarchitectures%20(Computer%20Organization)/🧝🏻‍♀️%20von%20Neumann%20Based%20Microarchitecture/👧🏽%20MARIE.md) for gists of microoperations & RTN

The ISA constitutes a set of **machine-level instructions** used by computer components to execute a program. Each instruction appears to be very simplistic; however, if you examine what actually happens at the **component level**, each instruction involves multiple “mini-instructions” being executed.


### RTN or RTL
The symbolic notation used to describe the behavior of microoperations is called **register transfer notation (RTN)** or **register transfer language (RTL)**. Each RTN instruction consists of one or more elementary RTN operations
