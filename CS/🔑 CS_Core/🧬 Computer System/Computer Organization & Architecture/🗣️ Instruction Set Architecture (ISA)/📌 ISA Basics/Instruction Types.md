### Instruction Orthogonality
Regardless of whether an architecture is hard-coded or microprogrammed, it is important that the architecture have a complete instruction set. However, designers must be careful not to add redundant instructions, as each instruction translates either to a circuit or a procedure. Therefore, each instruction should perform a unique function without duplicating any other instruction. Some people refer to this characteristic as orthogonality.
