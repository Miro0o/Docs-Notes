## 📜 ISA

## 🗿 Microarchitecture Models
Control units can be designed in one of two ways: They can be hardwired or they can be microprogrammed. These implement the ISA from design level to real physical machine.

### Harvard Based

> Many modern general-purpose computers use a modified version of the Harvard architecture in which they have **separate pathways for data and instructions but not separate storage**.
> 
> 🧐 Pure Harvard architectures are typically used in **microcontrollers** (an entire computer system on a chip), such as those found in embedded systems, as in appliances, toys, and cars.

### 🙈 More Architecture Models !
To list a few:
1. Neural networks (using ideas from models of the brain as a computing paradigm) implemented in silicon, cellular automata, cognitive computers (machines that learn by experience rather than through programming, e.g., IBM’s SyNAPSE computer, a machine that models the human brain);
2. Quantum computation (a combination of computing and quantum physics)
3. Dataflow computation;
4. Parallel computers.
