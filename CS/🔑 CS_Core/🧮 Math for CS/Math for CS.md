In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a **structure** is a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)) endowed with some additional features on the set (e.g. an [operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)), [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics)), [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)), or [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space)). Often, the additional features are attached or related to the set, so as to provide it with some additional meaning or significance.

A partial list of possible structures are:

-  [measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory)
- [algebraic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure) ([groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)), [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)), etc.)
- [topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
- [metric structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space) ([geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry))
- [orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory)
- [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_structure)
- [equivalence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation)
- [differential structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_structure)
- [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics)).

Sometimes, a set is endowed with more than one feature simultaneously, which allows mathematicians to study the interaction between the different structures more richly. For example, an ordering imposes a rigid form, shape, or topology on the set, and if a set has both a topology feature and a group feature, such that these two features are related in a certain way, then the structure becomes a [topological group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_group).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure#cite_note-1)

[Mappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics)) between sets which preserve structures (i.e., structures in the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function) are mapped to equivalent structures in the [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain)) are of special interest in many fields of mathematics. Examples are [homomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism), which preserve algebraic structures; [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism), which preserve topological structures;[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure#cite_note-2) and [diffeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism), which preserve differential structures.
