JGEX is a software which combines dynamic geometry software (DGS), automated geometry theorem prover (GTP) and our approach for visually dynamic presentation of proofs. As a dynamic geometry software, JGEX can be used to build dynamic visual models to assist teaching and learning of various mathematical concepts. As an automated reasoning software, we can build dynamic logic models which can do reasoning themselves. As a tool for dynamic presentation of proofs, JGEX is a valuable for teachers and students to write and present proofs of geometry theorems with various dynamic visual effects.

Manim is an engine for precise programmatic animations, designed for creating explanatory math videos.

Note, there are two versions of manim. This repository began as a personal project by the author of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) for the purpose of animating those videos, with video-specific code available [here](https://github.com/3b1b/videos). In 2020 a group of developers forked it into what is now the [community edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/), with a goal of being more stable, better tested, quicker to respond to community contributions, and all around friendlier to get started with. See [this page](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/installation.html#different-versions) for more details.
