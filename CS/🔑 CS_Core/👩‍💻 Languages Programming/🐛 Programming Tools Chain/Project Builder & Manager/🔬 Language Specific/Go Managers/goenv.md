## Intro
goenv aims to be as simple as possible and follow the already established successful version management model of [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) and [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

This project was cloned from [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) and modified for Go.

### goenv does...
- Let you **change the global Go version** on a per-user basis.
- Provide support for **per-project Go versions**.
- Allow you to **override the Go version** with an environment variable.
- Search commands from **multiple versions of Go at a time**.

### goenv compared to others:
- [https://github.com/pwoolcoc/goenv](https://github.com/pwoolcoc/goenv) depends on Python,
- [https://github.com/crsmithdev/goenv](https://github.com/crsmithdev/goenv) depends on Go,
- [https://github.com/moovweb/gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) is a different approach to the problem that's modeled after `nvm`. `goenv` is more simplified.
