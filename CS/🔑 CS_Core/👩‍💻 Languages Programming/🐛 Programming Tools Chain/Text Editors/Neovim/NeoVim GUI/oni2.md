## Intro
Onivim 2 is a reimagination of the [Oni](https://www.onivim.io/) editor. Onivim 2 aims to bring the _speed_ of Sublime, the _language integration_of VSCode, and the _modal editing experience_ of Vim together, in a single package.

Onivim 2 is built in [`reason`](https://reasonml.github.io/) using the [`revery`](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery) framework.

Onivim 2 uses [`libvim`](https://github.com/onivim/libvim) to manage buffers and provide authentic modal editing, and features a fast, native front-end. In addition, Onivim 2 leverages the VSCode Extension Host process in its entirety - meaning, eventually, complete support for VSCode extensions and configuration.
