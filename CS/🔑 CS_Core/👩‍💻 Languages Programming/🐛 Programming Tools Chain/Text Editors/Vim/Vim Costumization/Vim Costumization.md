" Set Namespaces to bold blue

### term, cterm, guiterm color

`termxx` is used by console version of Vim (when `set notermguicolors`). `guixx` is used in GVim, or in console if `set termguicolors`, and the console is capable of TrueColor, obviously. Hence you must test it in different programs to see the difference.

Also, some colors could be the same or very close to each other, e.g. "blue" is "blue" both in GUI and console.

> Can any one give me an illustrative example of how to use them?

``` json
hi Normal guifg=#1034a6 guibg=#f5f5dc ctermfg=19 ctermbg=230
```

Should look very similar but still a little different in GUI and console

For symbolic colors names see `:h cterm-colors` and `$VIMRUNTIME/rgb.txt`. The cheat sheet of 256 color indexes for console is available [here](https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/).

### Selected Color Schemes
#### 👉 [Solarized 8: True Colors](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8)
This is yet another Solarized theme for Vim. It places itself half way between the original [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) and the [Flattened](https://github.com/romainl/flattened) variant. It removes only *some* of the bullshit. The color palette is exactly the same as in Solarized, although some highlight groups are defined slightly differently (for instance, I have tried to avoid red on blue).

The main reason for the existence of this project is that the original Solarized theme does not define `guifg` and `guibg` in terminal Vim, making it unsuitable for versions of Vim supporting true-color (i.e., 24-bit color) terminals. Instead, this color scheme works **out of the box everywhere**. For the best experience, you need:

- Vim ≥7.4.1799, or NeoVim, with `termguicolors` set, **and**
- a terminal supporting millions of colors (but see below for workarounds)

"   - Vim (Linux/macOS): '~/.vim/plugged'
"   - Vim (Windows): '~/vimfiles/plugged'
"   - Neovim (Linux/macOS/Windows): stdpath('data') . '/plugged'
" You can specify a custom plugin directory by passing it as the argument
"   - e.g. `call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')`
"   - Avoid using standard Vim directory names like 'plugin'

" Make sure you use single quotes

" Shorthand notation; fetches https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align
Plug 'junegunn/vim-easy-align'

" Any valid git URL is allowed
Plug 'https://github.com/junegunn/vim-github-dashboard.git'

" Multiple Plug commands can be written in a single line using | separators
Plug 'SirVer/ultisnips' | Plug 'honza/vim-snippets'

" On-demand loading
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree', { 'on': 'NERDTreeToggle' }
Plug 'tpope/vim-fireplace', { 'for': 'clojure' }

" Using a non-default branch
Plug 'rdnetto/YCM-Generator', { 'branch': 'stable' }

" Using a tagged release; wildcard allowed (requires git 1.9.2 or above)
Plug 'fatih/vim-go', { 'tag': '*' }

" Plugin options
Plug 'nsf/gocode', { 'tag': 'v.20150303', 'rtp': 'vim' }

" Plugin outside ~/.vim/plugged with post-update hook
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'dir': '~/.fzf', 'do': './install --all' }

" Initialize plugin system
" - Automatically executes `filetype plugin indent on` and `syntax enable`.
call plug#end()
" You can revert the settings after the call like so:
"   filetype indent off   " Disable file-type-specific indentation
"   syntax off            " Disable syntax highlighting
```

#### basics
`mf` mark file ;
`mt` mark target;
`mx` | `mc` | `mm` : operation on marked file / marked target

> When you try to do something on marked files, the action only applies to the files that are listed in the current buffer.


### 👉 [NERDtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)
#### Intro
The NERDTree is a file system explorer for the Vim editor. Using this plugin, users can visually browse complex directory hierarchies, quickly open files for reading or editing, and perform basic file system operations.

#### Getting Started
After installing NERDTree, the best way to learn it is to turn on the Quick Help. Open NERDTree with the `:NERDTree` command, and press `?` to turn on the Quick Help, which will show you all the mappings and commands available in the NERDTree. Of course, your most complete source of information is the documentation: `:help NERDTree`.

### Fonts / Icons
#TODO 

#### 👉 [VimDevIcons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons)

**Installation**
1. Install a [Nerd Font compatible font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-installation) or [patch your own](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher). Then set your terminal font (or `guifont` if you are using GUI version of Vim).

Plug 'ryanoasis/vim-devicons'
```
Always load the vim-devicons as the very last one.

3. Configure Vim
```shell
set encoding=UTF-8
```
No need to set explicitly under Neovim: always uses UTF-8 as the default encoding.

> See [Installation](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons/wiki/Installation) for detailed setup instructions

Use `:help devicons` for further configuration.

#### 👉 Neomake
🏠 https://github.com/neomake/neomake

Neomake is a plugin for [Vim](http://vim.org/)/[Neovim](http://neovim.org/) to asynchronously run programs.

You can use it instead of the built-in `:make` command (since it can pick up your `'makeprg'` setting), but its focus is on providing an extra layer of makers based on the current file (type) or project. Its origin is a proof-of-concept for [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) to be asynchronous.


#### 👉 ale
🏠 https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale

![|500](../../../../../../../Assets/Pics/ale.jpeg)

ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine) is a plugin providing linting (syntax checking and semantic errors) in NeoVim 0.2.0+ and Vim 8.0+ while you edit your text files, and acts as a Vim [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) client.
