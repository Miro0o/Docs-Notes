#### 3️⃣ Static code analysis
The smartest "Jump to Definition" mechanic would definitely rely on parsing and analyzing the code itself, which is what static analysis engines are for.

There are multiple plugins out there that work to integrate with these engines, e.g. [tern_for_vim](https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim) for Javascript. Try and find one for your language of choice, or ask some of the helpful chaps in [r/vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/) or \#vim on freenode!

##### Language Server Protocol!
which aims to provide a standard for text editors and static analysis engines to work together.
