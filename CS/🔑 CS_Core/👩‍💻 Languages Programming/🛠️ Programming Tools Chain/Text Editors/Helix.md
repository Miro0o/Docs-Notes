## Intro
A Kakoune / Neovim inspired editor, written in Rust.

The editing model is very heavily based on Kakoune; during development I found myself agreeing with most of Kakoune's design decisions.

For more information, see theÂ [website](https://helix-editor.com/)Â orÂ [documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be foundÂ [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

### Features
- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

It's a terminal-based editor first, but I'd like to explore a custom renderer (similar to Emacs) in wgpu or skulpin.

Note: Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. CheckÂ `runtime/queries/<lang>/`Â forÂ `indents.scm`.
