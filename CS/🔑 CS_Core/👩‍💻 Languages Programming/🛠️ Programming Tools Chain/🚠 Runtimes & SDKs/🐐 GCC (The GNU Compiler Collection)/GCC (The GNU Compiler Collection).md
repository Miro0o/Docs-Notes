GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection is not only GNU C Compiler! 



## Intro
The *GNU Compiler Collection （GCC）* includes front ends for **[C](https://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html), [C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html), Objective-C, [Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/), Ada, Go, and D**, as well as **libraries** for these languages (libstdc++,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler for the [**GNU operating system**](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html). The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software, free in the sense that it [respects the user's freedom](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

> 🖇 See my GUN notes on ↗ [GNU (GNU's Not Unix)](../../../../🥷🏼%20Operating%20System%20(Tech)/Linux%20(Derived%20From%20UNIX%20Family)/🐑%20GNU%20(GNU's%20Not%20Unix)/GNU%20(GNU's%20Not%20Unix).md)

GCC strives to provide regular, high-quality [releases](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html), which are expected to work well on a variety of native and cross-targets (including GNU/Linux). GCC also encourages everyone to [contribute](https://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html) changes or help [testing](https://gcc.gnu.org/testing/) GCC. 

Sources are readily and freely available via [Git](https://gcc.gnu.org/git.html) and weekly [snapshots](https://gcc.gnu.org/snapshots.html).

> Major decisions about GCC are made by the [steering committee](https://gcc.gnu.org/steering.html), guided by the [mission statement](https://gcc.gnu.org/gccmission.html).
