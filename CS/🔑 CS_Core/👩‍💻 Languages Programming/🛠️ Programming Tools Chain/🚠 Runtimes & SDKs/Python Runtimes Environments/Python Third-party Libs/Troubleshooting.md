## ðŸ‘‰ PIL.UnidentifiedImageError: cannot identify image file
#PIL 


**\#1 Image format unsupported**
skip.. (see ref)

---
**\#2 Target file unavailable**
This could be the file path error, or the file itself is not available. 

> **ðŸ’¡ In my case** I was running into this problem on Respray Pi. Turns out I was using two process to access the same file concurrently but Respray PI doesn't seem to support this. ðŸ˜’ It means when i access it from one process the other process still holds it (with lock) and the lock is mutual exclusive, hence i cannot access it until the holder release the lock.

## ðŸ‘‰ UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xa5 in position 0: invalid start byte
#utf8

The error is because there is some non-ascii character in the dictionary and it can't be encoded/decoded. One simple way to avoid this error is to encode such strings withÂ `encode()`function as follows (ifÂ `a`Â is the string with non-ascii character):
```python
a.encode('utf-8').strip()
```
---

I switched this simply by defining a different codec package in theÂ `read_csv()`Â command:
`encoding = 'unicode_escape'`

Eg:
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv(filename, encoding= 'unicode_escape')
```
