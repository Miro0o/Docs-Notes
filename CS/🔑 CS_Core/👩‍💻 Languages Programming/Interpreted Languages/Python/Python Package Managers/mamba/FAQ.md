Otherwise, one can switch to using Anaconda packages by adding the `anaconda` channel, as in [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68991641/570918). Just be aware that [channel mixing can be messy](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html#using-multiple-channels). Personally, I would just stick to Conda Forge.
