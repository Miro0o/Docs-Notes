## üëâ How to force stop a python process

**level 1:**
`CTRL + C `  to raise  `KeyboardInterrupt`

**level 2:**
1. approach #1
`CREL + Z` to suspend the process
`jobs` to check the current suspended process
`fg %n` to resume the suspended process, where `n` is the corresponding number of the process listed by `jobs`.
`kill %n` kills the listed `n` process

2.  approach #2
`ps aux | grep python` check the PID (Process ID) of the running process
`kill <PID>` to kill the process
> `kill` command send a `SIGTERM` signal to the system by default. 

**level 3:**
if `SIGTERM`dosen't work, then send `SIGKILL` signal.
use `kill -KILL <pid>` (or `kill -9 <pid>`) to achieve this. 



## üëâ [Fix Pip ‚ÄúYanked Version‚Äù Warnings](https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/09/20/how-to-fix-pip-yanked-version-warnings/)
#pip

PyPI allows package maintainers to yank a given version. This is intended for removing versions with bad faults, such as security holes or broken installation.

The maintainer *could* delete the version, but this would break all installations pinned to that version, unleashing chaos. Yanking the version instead marks the version as unsafe, making it somewhat invisible while allowing pinned installs to succeed.

Conventionally, while yanking a pck the maintainer will also relesase a secure version. Generally if one doesn't specifically designate a version when piping pcks, pip will automaticallty choose the secure version.

When Yanked Version warnning occurred, to fix it we need to find an un-yanked version of the package that will work for us. This might mean upgrading, downgrading, or waiting for a new version. Upgrading is the most common course of action, since if a maintainer has yanked a version, they‚Äôve likely released a fix shortly after.

**TL;DR**
- Use **absolute** imports
- **Append your project‚Äôs root directory to** `PYTHONPATH` ‚Äî In any environment you wish to run your Python application such as Docker, vagrant or your virtual environment i.e. in bin/activate, run (or e.g. add to `bin/activate` in case you are using virtualenv) the below command:
```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/your/project/"
```

- **avoid using `sys.path.append("/path/to/your/project/")`**
