## Intro
> **PyG** _(PyTorch Geometric)_ is a library built upon [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for a wide range of applications related to structured data.
> 
> It consists of various methods for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures, also known as [geometric deep learning](http://geometricdeeplearning.com/), from a variety of published papers. In addition, it consists of easy-to-use mini-batch loaders for operating on many small and single giant graphs, [multi GPU-support](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/examples/multi_gpu), [torch.compile](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/compile.html) support, [DataPipe](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/datapipe.py) support, a large number of common benchmark datasets (based on simple interfaces to create your own), the [GraphGym](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/graphgym.html) experiment manager, and helpful transforms, both for learning on arbitrary graphs as well as on 3D meshes or point clouds.
