## Intro
Perl officially stands for __Practical Extraction and Report Language__, except when it doesn't.
- Perl was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those text files, and printing reports based on that information.
- It quickly became a good language for many system management tasks. 
- Over the years, Perl has grown into a general-purpose programming language. It's widely used for everything from quick "one-liners" to full-scale application development.

The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).
- It combines (in the author's opinion, anyway) some of the best features of **sed**, **awk**, and **sh**, making it familiar and easy to use for Unix users to whip up quick solutions to annoying problems.
- Its general-purpose programming facilities support procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms, making Perl a comfortable language for the long haul on major projects, whatever your bent.

Perl's roots in text processing haven't been forgotten over the years.
- It still boasts some of the most powerful regular expressions to be found anywhere
- and its support for Unicode text is world-class.
- It handles all kinds of structured text, too, through an extensive collection of extensions. Those libraries, collected in the **CPAN**, provide ready-made solutions to an astounding array of problems. When they haven't set the standard themselves, they steal from the best -- just like Perl itself.
