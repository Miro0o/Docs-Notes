C++
Released in 1979, Wilkerson says that C++ was specifically created to add objects and instance methods (object behavior) to the original C language. This was based on the idea that object-oriented programming would be more effective and efficient for large software projects—something that Hubben points to as a reason for C++’s wide adoption in the years since. Hubben says that C++ is the language used to write many current desktop applications (including Adobe programs like Photoshop, Mozilla’s Firefox web browser, and the Microsoft Windows operating system), and—as a result of this large usage base—a vast number of [frameworks and libraries (opens in a new tab)](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/links/libs)(collections of tools used to develop software, websites, or apps) have been built to extend C++ for functions like high-performance graphics, audio digital signal processing, and user interface design. Meanwhile, Wilkerson says that C++’s [standard library (opens in a new tab)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference)is so huge that beginners can get up and running on projects without having to write a lot of common code themselves, even without venturing into third party libraries.

C#
While C++ was derived directly from the original C language, C# is an object-oriented programming language that was “inspired by” C. First appearing in the year 2000, Hubben says C# is the language used to develop programs within Microsoft’s .NET framework (Microsoft’s proprietary framework for developing Windows software and applications). Although it’s primarily used for software running on the Windows platform, Hubben says C# is not exclusive to it, and is well-suited for general object-oriented programming projects both small and large.

Objective-C
Hubben says that Objective-C was developed in the late 1980’s with the aim of building a flexible object-oriented programing language with a focus on reusability of code. Objective-C’s creators added some concepts found in another language called [Smalltalk(opens in a new tab)](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/musings/SmalltalkOverview.html) , believing this would improve upon C++ as a C-based object-oriented language. Hubben says that Objective-C was adopted by a company called NeXT—Steve Jobs’ computer company he formed before returning to Apple in the late 1980’s—and eventually became the foundation for OSX and iOS (Apple’s desktop and mobile operting systems, respextively). However, Hubben says that in recent years Apple has begun replacing Objective-C with a language called Swift, as [the company is moving away from C-style languages(opens in a new tab)](https://www.wired.com/2014/06/apple-swift-language/).
