# DSL(Domain Specific Languages) & GPL(General Purpose Languages)

## Intro
A **domain-specific language** (**DSL**) is a [computer language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language "Computer language") specialized to a particular application [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(software_engineering) "Domain (software engineering)"). This is in contrast to a [general-purpose language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language "General-purpose language")(GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains. There are a wide variety of DSLs, ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") for web pages, down to languages used by only one or a few pieces of software, such as [MUSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSH "MUSH") soft code. DSLs can be further subdivided by the kind of language, and include domain-specific [_markup_ languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language"), domain-specific [_modeling_ languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_language "Modeling language") (more generally, [specification languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_language "Specification language")), and domain-specific [_programming_ languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"). Special-purpose computer languages have always existed in the computer age, but the term "domain-specific language" has become more popular due to the rise of [domain-specific modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_modeling "Domain-specific modeling"). Simpler DSLs, particularly ones used by a single application, are sometimes informally called **mini-languages**.

The line between general-purpose languages and domain-specific languages is not always sharp, as a language may have specialized features for a particular domain but be applicable more broadly, or conversely may in principle be capable of broad application but in practice used primarily for a specific domain. For example, [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl") was originally developed as a text-processing and glue language, for the same domain as [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK "AWK") and [shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script "Shell script"), but was mostly used as a general-purpose programming language later on. By contrast, [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript "PostScript") is a [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete "Turing-complete") language, and in principle can be used for any task, but in practice is narrowly used as a [page description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_description_language "Page description language").
