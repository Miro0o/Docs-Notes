## ðŸ‘‰ GO111MODULE Related
You might have noticed thatÂ `GO111MODULE=on`Â is flourishing everywhere. Many readmes have that:
```bash
GO111MODULE=on
go get golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

Note thatÂ `go get`Â has been deprecated for installing binaries since Go 1.17 and will be become impossible in Go 1.18. If you are using Go 1.16 or above, you should use instead:
```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
# with no GO111MODULE=on required and you shouldn't
```

In this short post, I will explain whyÂ `GO111MODULE`Â was introduced in Go 1.11, its caveats and interesting bits that you need to know when dealing with Go Modules.
