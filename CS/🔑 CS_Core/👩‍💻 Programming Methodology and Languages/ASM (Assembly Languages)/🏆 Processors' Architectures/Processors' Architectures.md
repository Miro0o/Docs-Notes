## Intro
> Note: 
> Conceptions of ISA & CPU organization always come together despite different aspects of the objects they address. This part of notes, Processors' architecture, focus on **architecture**, while the â†— [Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)](../../../ðŸ§¬%20Computer%20System/Computer%20Architecture/Instruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA)/Instruction%20Set%20Architecture%20(ISA).md) part focus on **instruction sets**. The confusion part of this is the CPU naming convention, where there always been (ISA name) + architecture, which may make it mixed with ISA specifications. But again, to be clear this note is about CPU not ISA.
