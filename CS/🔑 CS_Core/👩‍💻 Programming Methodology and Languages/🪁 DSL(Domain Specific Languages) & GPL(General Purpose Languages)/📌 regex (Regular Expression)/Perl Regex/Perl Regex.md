Perl regexes have become a de facto standard, having a rich and powerful set of atomic expressions. Perl has no "basic" or "extended" levels. As in POSIX EREs, `( )` and `{ }` are treated as meta-characters unless escaped; other meta-characters are known to be literal or symbolic based on context alone. Additional functionality includes [lazy matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Lazy_matching),Â [backreferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#backreferences), named capture groups, andÂ [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science) "Recursion (computer science)") patterns.
