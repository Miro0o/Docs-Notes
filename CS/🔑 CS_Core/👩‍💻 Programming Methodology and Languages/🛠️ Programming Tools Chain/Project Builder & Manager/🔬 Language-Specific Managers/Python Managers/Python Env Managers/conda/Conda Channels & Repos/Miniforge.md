This repository holds a minimal installer forÂ [Conda](https://conda.io/)Â specific toÂ [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/). 



## Intro
Miniforge allows you to install the conda package manager with the following features pre-configured:
- [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)Â set as the default (and only) channel.
    - Packages in the base environment are obtained from theÂ [conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge).
- Optional support for PyPy in place of standard Python interpreter (aka "CPython").
- Optional support forÂ [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)Â in place of Conda.
- An emphasis on supporting various CPU architectures (x86_64, ppc64le, and aarch64 including Apple M1).

It can be compared to theÂ â†— [miniconda](../Python%20Distributions/miniconda.md)Â installer.
