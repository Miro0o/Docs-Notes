## Res



## Intro
**Ruby Interactive (ri)** documentation was installed. ri is kind of like man
pages for Ruby libraries. You may access it like this:
```shell
ri Classname
ri Classname.class_method
ri Classname#instance_method
```
If you do not wish to install this documentation in the future, use the `--no-document` flag, or set it as the default in your `~/.gemrc` file. See '`gem help env`' for details.
