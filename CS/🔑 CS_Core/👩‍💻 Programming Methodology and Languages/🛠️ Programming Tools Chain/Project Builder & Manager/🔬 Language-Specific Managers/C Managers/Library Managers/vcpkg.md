## Intro
First, follow the quick start guide for eitherÂ [Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start-windows), orÂ [macOS and Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start-unix), depending on what you're using.

For more information, seeÂ [Installing and Using Packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/examples/installing-and-using-packages). If a library you need is not present in the vcpkg catalog, you canÂ [open an issue on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/new/choose)Â where the vcpkg team and community can see it, and potentially add the port to vcpkg.

After you've gotten vcpkg installed and working, you may wish to addÂ [tab completion](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg?tab=readme-ov-file#tab-completionauto-completion)Â to your shell.
