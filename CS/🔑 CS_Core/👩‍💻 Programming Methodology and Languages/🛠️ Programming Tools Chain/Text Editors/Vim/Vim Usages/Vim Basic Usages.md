## 🎯 Navigation
### Navigation within File



### Navigation betweent Files


### Go TO Definition
#### 1️⃣ include & define

#### 2️⃣ Ctags


#### 3️⃣ Static code analysis
The smartest "Jump to Definition" mechanic would definitely rely on parsing and analyzing the code itself, which is what static analysis engines are for.

There are multiple plugins out there that work to integrate with these engines, e.g. [tern_for_vim](https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim) for Javascript. Try and find one for your language of choice, or ask some of the helpful chaps in [r/vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/) or \#vim on freenode!

##### Language Server Protocol!
which aims to provide a standard for text editors and static analysis engines to work together.

## 🫦 Shell Command Execution


## 🔎 Find & Substitute
### Syntaxs & Usecase
``` vim
:[range]s/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]
```

The command searches each line in `[range]` for a `{pattern}`, and replaces it with a `{string}`. `[count]` is a positive integer that multiplies the command.

If no `[range]` and `[count]` are given, only the pattern found in the current line is replaced. The current line is the line where the cursor is placed.

e.g.

```shell
:s/foo/bar/

#### % for whole range & g for entire line
:s/foo/bar/g
:%s/foo/bar/g
:s/foo//g

#### i for case insensitive & I for case sensitive
:s/Foo/bar/gi
:s/Foo/bar/gI


#### Substituting whole word (default look for the pattern as a string not a whole word)
:s/\<Foo\>/bar/gi
```


#### 1️⃣ Delimiters
Instead of the slash character (`/`), you can use any other non-alphanumeric single-byte character except as a delimiter. This option is useful when you have the ‘/’ character in the search pattern or the replacement string.
```vim
:s|foo|bar|
```


#### 2️⃣ Confirm Substitution
To confirm each substitution, use the `c` flag:
```vi
:s/foo/bar/gc
```
Output:
``` vim
replace with bar (y/n/a/q/l/^E/^Y)?
```
Press `y` to replace the match or `l` to replace the match and quit. Press `n` to skip the match and `q` or `Esc` to quit substitution. The `a` option substitutes the match and all remaining occurrences of the match. To scroll the screen down, use `CTRL+Y`, and to scroll up, use `CTRL+E`.


#### 3️⃣ Regualr Expressions
You can also use [regular expressions](https://linuxize.com/post/regular-expressions-in-grep/) as a search pattern. The command bellow replaces all lines starting with ‘foo’ with ‘Vim is the best’:
```vim
:%s/^foo.*/Vim is the best/gc
```
The `^` (caret) symbol matches the beginning of a line and `.*` matches any number of any characters.


#### 4️⃣ Search Range
To substitute all occurrences of ‘foo’ to ‘bar’ in all lines starting from line 3 to line 10 you would use:
```vim
:3,10s/foo/bar/g
```
The range is inclusive, which means that the first and last lines are included in the range.

To substitute ‘foo’ in all lines starting from the current line to the last one:
```vi
:.,$s/foo/bar/
```

The line specifier can also be set using the ‘+’ or ‘-’ symbol,followed by a number that is added or subtracted from the preceding line number. If the number after the symbol is omitted, it defaults to 1.

For example to substitute each ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ starting from the current line and the four next lines, type:

```vi
:.,+4s/foo/bar/g
```

[Find and Replace in Vim / Vi]: https://linuxize.com/post/vim-find-replace/#search-range


### Examples 
Comment lines (add `#` before the line) from 5 to 20:
```vi
:5,20s/^/#/
```

Uncomment lines from 5 to the end, revert the previous changes:
```vi
:5,$s/^#//
```

Replace all instances of ‘apple’, ‘orange’, and ‘mango’ with ‘fruit’:
```vi
:%s/apple\|orange\|mango/fruit/g
```

Remove trailing whitespace at the end of each line:
```vi
:%s/\s\+$//e
```



## 🎏 Muiltiple Windows & Files
### Tabs
> 🔗 https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/vim-tips-using-tabs/


Tabs can be extremely useful, and it only takes a short while to become proficient with them. For more on working with tabs in Vim, run `:help tab-page-intro` within Vim.

#### Opening a tab
```shell
# Probably the easiest to open a new tab
:tabnew 
:tabnew filename


# Another way to do this is to open more than one file at startup using the `-p` option. If you want to open three files in separate tabs, you’d use this syntax:
vim -p file1 file2 file3

# The default maximum is 10 tabs, but you can change this by setting the `tabpagemax` option in your .vimrc, like so:
set tabpagemax=15

#  search for a file in your current path and open it in a new tab
#  For instance, if you want to open a file called inventory.txt that’s in your current path, you could run:
:tabf inven*
```

#### Moving between tabs
You can switch between tabs using `:tabn` and `:tabp`, or you can use `gt` while you’re in normal mode. Of course, if you’re using Vim’s GUI, GVim, you can also use the mouse to switch between tabs or use keyboard shortcuts. In GVim, you can also access a context menu for tabs by right-clicking on the tab bar. Here you can open new tabs with a new buffer or an existing file, or close the current tab.

If you have a lot of tabs open, you can use `:tabfirst`, or just `:tabfir`, to jump to the first tab, and `:tablast` to jump to the last tab that’s open.


#### Rearranging tabs
If you’re really meticulous and want to position tabs _just so_ in Vim, you can move the tabs to a specific spot in the tab order using `:tabm _n_`, where `_n_` is the position number that you want to use. If you don’t give the `:tabm` command an argument, then the current tab will be moved to the last spot.


#### Running commands in tabs
```shell
:tabdo %s/foo/bar/g

```

### Buffers


### Horizontal /Vertical Split Panes
You can have multiple windows within the same tab page.

- `:split filename` open file for editing in a new horizontal window, above the current window 
    - you can also use `:sp` instead of `:split`
    - `:set splitbelow` open horizontal splits below the current window
- :vsplit filename open file for editing in a new vertical window, to the left of the current window 
    - you can also use `:vs` instead of `:vsplit`
    - `:set splitright` open vertical splits to the right of the current window

Here are some shortcuts to navigate between windows:
- `Ctrl+w` followed by `w` switch to the below/right window for horizontal/vertical splits respectively 
    - `Ctrl+w` followed by `Ctrl+w` also performs the same function
    - switches to the first split if you are on the last split
- `Ctrl+w` followed by `W` switch to the above/left window for horizontal/vertical splits respectively 
    - switches to the last split if you are on the first split
- `Ctrl+w` followed by `hjkl` or arrow keys, switch in the respective direction
- `Ctrl+w` followed by t or b switch to the top (first) or bottom (last) window
- `Ctrl+w` followed by `HJKL` (uppercase), moves the current split to the farthest possible location in the respective direction


>  If filename is not provided, the current one is used.

>  Vim adds a highlighted horizontal bar containing the filename for each split.

```s
:vimgrep /JFactory/ **/*.java
```
You can replace the pattern `/JFactory/` with `/\<JFactory\>/` if you want full word match. `:vim` is shorthand for `:vimgrep`.

...

Note that if you want an external program to grep your pattern you can do something like the following:

```
:set grepprg=ack
:grep --java JFactory
```
