Unlike other GDB plugins, GEF has an extensive and up-to-dateÂ [documentation](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/). Users are recommended to refer to it as it may help them in their attempts to use GEF. In particular, new users should navigate through it (see the [FAQ](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/faq/)Â for common installation problems), and the problem persists, try to reach out for help on the Discord channel or submit an issue.



## Intro
`GEF`Â (pronounced Ê¤É›f - "Jeff") is a set of commands for x86/64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC and SPARC to assist exploit developers and reverse-engineers when using old school GDB. It provides additional features to GDB using the Python API to assist during the process of dynamic analysis and exploit development. Application developers will also benefit from it, as GEF lifts a great part of regular GDB obscurity, avoiding repeating traditional commands, or bringing out the relevant information from the debugging runtime.
