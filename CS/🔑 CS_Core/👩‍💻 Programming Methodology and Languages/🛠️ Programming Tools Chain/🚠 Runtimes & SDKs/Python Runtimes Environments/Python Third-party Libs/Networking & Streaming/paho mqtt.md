## Intro
The MQTT protocol is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/‚ÄùInternet of Things‚Äù connectivity protocol. Designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport, it is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
