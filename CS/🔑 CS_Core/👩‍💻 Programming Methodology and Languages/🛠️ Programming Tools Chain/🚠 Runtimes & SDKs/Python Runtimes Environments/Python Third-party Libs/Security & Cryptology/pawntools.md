## Intro
Pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.

```python
from pwn import *
context(arch = 'i386', os = 'linux')

r = remote('exploitme.example.com', 31337)
# EXPLOIT CODE GOES HERE
r.send(asm(shellcraft.sh()))
r.interactive()
```
