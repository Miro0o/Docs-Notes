## Intro
Manim is an animation engine for explanatory math videos. You can use it to make math videos (or other fields) like 3Blue1Brown.

There are mainly two versions here:
- [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) : Maintained by Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown.
	- Using OpenGL and its GLSL language to use GPU for rendering. It has higher efficiency, faster rendering speed, and supports real-time rendering and interaction.

- [ManimCommunity/manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) : Maintained by Manim Community Dev Team.
	- Using multiple backend rendering. There is better documentation and a more open contribution community.
