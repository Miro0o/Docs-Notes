## Intro
TraceMonkey adds native‐code compilation to Mozilla’s JavaScript® engine (known as “SpiderMonkey”). It is based on a technique developed at UC Irvine called [“trace trees”](http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Efranz/Site/pubs-pdf/ICS-TR-06-16.pdf), and building on code and ideas shared with the Tamarin Tracing project. The net result is a massive speed increase both in the browser chrome and Web‐page content.
