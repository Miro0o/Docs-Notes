**GNAT** is a free-software compiler for the [Ada programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language) "Ada (programming language)") which forms part of the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection "GNU Compiler Collection")(GCC). It supports all versions of the language, i.e. Ada 2012, Ada 2005, Ada 95 and Ada 83. Originally its name was an acronym that stood for _**G**NU **N**YU **A**da **T**ranslator_, but that name no longer applies. The front-end and run-time are written in Ada.
