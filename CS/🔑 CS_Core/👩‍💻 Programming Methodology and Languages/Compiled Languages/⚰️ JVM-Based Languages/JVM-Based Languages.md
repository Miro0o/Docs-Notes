## Intro
> ðŸ”— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages

This **list of JVM Languages** comprises notable computer [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) that are used to produce computer [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) that runs on the [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) (JVM). Some of these languages are [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) by a [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) program, and some are compiled to [Java bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode)and [JIT-compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) during execution as regular Java programs to improve performance.

The JVM was initially designed to support only the programming language Java. However, as time passed, even more languages were adapted or designed to run on the [Java platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)).


### High-profile languages
As of September 2022, according to the TIOBE Index[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages#cite_note-tiobe_top_languages-1) of the top 100 programming languages, the top JVM languages are:

- [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) (#3), a [statically-typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking) [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) language
- [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)) (#33), a statically-typed object-oriented and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) language
- [Kotlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)) (#34, at one point at #27), a statically-typed language from [JetBrains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBrains), the developers of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA) and Google's preferred language for Android
- [Groovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Groovy) (#41, before #32), a [dynamic programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language) (also with static typing) and [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language).
- [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) (#47), a [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language), and [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) [dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_(computing)) of the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language).
