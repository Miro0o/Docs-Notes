## [Shell integration](https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html)

iTerm2 may be integrated with the unix shell so that it can keep track of your command history, current working directory, host name, and moreâ€”even over ssh. This enables several useful features.

TBD..

### Features

Shell Integration enables numerous features:

**Marks**

These are saved locations in history. They make it easy to navigate to previous shell prompts or other locations of interest.

**Alert when current command finishes running.**

iTerm2 will present a modal alert when a long-running command finishes, if you ask it to.

**View information about commands.**

You can see the return status code, working directory, running time, and more for shell commands entered at the prompt in the past.

**Download files from remote hosts with a click.**

You can right click on a filename (e.g., in the output of *ls*) to download it.

**Drag-drop files to upload with scp.**

Hold down option and drag-drop a file from Finder into iTerm2 to upload it.

**View command history.**

It can be seen and searched in the toolbelt or quickly accessed in a popup window.

**Easy access to recently and frequently used directories.**

iTerm2 remembers the directories you use, sorting them by "frecency" and giving you access to them in the toolbelt and in a popup window.

**Assign profiles to hostnames, usernames, or username+hostname combinations.**

Sessions will automatically switch profiles as you log in and out according to rules you define.

**Ensures the command prompt always starts at the left column, even when the last command didn't end in a newline.**

Each of these features are described in more detail below.
