**Zsh** is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of *bash*, *ksh*, and *tcsh* were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added.

1️⃣The [introductory document](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Intro/intro_toc.html) details some of the unique features of zsh. It assumes basic knowledge of the standard UNIX shells; the intent is to show a reader already familiar with one of the other major shells what makes zsh more useful or more powerful. This document is not at all comprehensive;2️⃣ [read the manual](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/) entry for a description of the shell that is complete, concise and up-to-date, although somewhat overwhelming and devoid of examples. 3️⃣ Alternatively, the [user guide](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/zshguide.html) offers wordy explanations of many of the shell's features. If you want to read something that has been polished by a professional editor you can [buy the book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590593766/).

  [oh-my-zsh](Shell Helper/oh-my-zsh.md) is a feature rich zsh framework.

Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town *or your money back!* With each keystroke in your command prompt, you'll take advantage of the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes. Strangers will come up to you in cafés and ask you, *"that is amazing! are you some sort of genius?"*

Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you have always felt you deserved. ...or maybe you'll use the time that you're saving to start flossing more often. 😬
