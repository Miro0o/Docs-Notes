The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system. **These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system.**



## Getting GNU Coreutils

The latest source with revision history can be browsed using [cgit](https://git.sv.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git), [gitweb](https://git.sv.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git) or [GitHub](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils).
Assuming you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, you can retrieve the latest version with this command:
