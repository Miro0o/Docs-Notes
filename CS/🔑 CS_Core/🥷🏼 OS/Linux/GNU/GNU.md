[GUN](https://www.gnu.org), (GNU's Not Unix), pronunced as *Guh-NOO*, aka GUN project, is a free operating system, using **linux** and **hurd** as its kernal. 

> GUN is licensed by [**GPL**](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/123268399) ( [GPL-- ref](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU通用公共许可证) )(GNU General Public License), which guarantees its complete freeness in distribution.

GNU is an operating system that is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)—that is, it respects users' freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom.

We recommend [installable versions of GNU](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html) (more precisely, GNU/Linux distributions) which are entirely free software. [More about GNU below](https://www.gnu.org/#More-GNU).

### GNU History

- *[1996] [Overview of the GNU System](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html)
- *[1998] [The GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html) (by Richard Stallman) — A more detailed history of GNU.

- [1989] [One Man's Fight for Free Software](https://web.archive.org/web/20210820153013/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/11/business/business-technology-one-man-s-fight-for-free-software.html) (by John Markoff) — An article about Richard Stallman and the early GNU development, published at The New York Times on January 11, 1989. One problem with the article is that it uses the propaganda term “intellectual property” as if that referred to something coherent. The term is such a confusion that talking about it [makes no sense](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html). The article is also somewhat confused in regard to Symbolics. What Stallman did, while still working at MIT, was to write, independently, replacement improvements comparable to the improvements that Symbolics made in its version of the MIT Lisp Machine System.

Here are two postings that Stallman wrote for a bulletin board at Stanford while he was visiting there in May, 1983. They show some of his thinking on the way towards launching the development of the GNU system. They don't use the term “free software”; apparently he had not yet started to put those two words together.

#### (9965) GNU

Main-belt asteroid [(9965) GNU](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=9965), provisionally designated as 1992 EF2, was named after the GNU project in the [Minor Planet Circular 41571](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/2000/MPC_20001111.pdf). The asteroid was discovered at Kitt Peak by Spacewatch on the 5th March 1992.
