Whonix is a Kicksecure–based security hardened Linux distribution. Its main goals are to provide strong privacy and anonymity on the Internet. The operating system consists of two virtual machines, a "Workstation" and a Tor "Gateway", running Debian GNU/Linux. All communications are forced through the Tor network.
