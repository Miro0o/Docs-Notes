## Intro

[Termshark User Guide](https://github.com/gcla/termshark/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#table-of-contents)



## What's next?

As I write this, I'm about to release termshark v2.4. Here's what might come in v2.5 and beyond:

- Built-in support for editing packet color profiles
- Expose many more of tshark's `-z` options
- HTTP statistics and Wireshark's I/O graph
- Allow the user to start reading from available interfaces once the UI has started
- Anything you raise on Github issues - let me know what features you'd like!
