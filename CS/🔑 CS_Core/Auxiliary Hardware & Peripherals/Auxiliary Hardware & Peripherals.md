## Intro
A **peripheral device** or **peripheral** is an auxiliary hardware device used to transfer information into and out of a computer. The term _peripheral device_ refers to all hardware components that are attached to a computer and are controlled by the computer system, but they are not the core components of the computer.

Several categories of peripheral devices may be identified, based on their relationship with the computer:
- An **input device** sends data or instructions to the computer, such as a [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse "Computer mouse"), [keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard "Computer keyboard"), [graphics tablet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_tablet "Graphics tablet"), [image scanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner "Image scanner"), [barcode reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode_reader "Barcode reader"), [game controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_controller "Game controller"), [light pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pen "Light pen"), [light gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_gun "Light gun"), [microphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone "Microphone") and [webcam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam "Webcam");

- An **output device** provides output data from the computer, such as a [computer monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor "Computer monitor"), [projector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projector "Projector"), [printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing) "Printer (computing)"), [headphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones "Headphones") and [computer speaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_speakers "Computer speakers");

- An **input/output device** performs both input and output functions, such as a [computer data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage "Computer data storage") device (including a [disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_storage "Disk storage"), [solid-state drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive "Solid-state drive"), [USB flash drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive "USB flash drive"), [memory card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_card "Memory card") and [tape drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_drive "Tape drive")), [modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem "Modem"), [network adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_adapter "Network adapter") and [multi-function printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-function_printer "Multi-function printer").

Many modern electronic devices, such as Internet-enabled [digital watches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watch "Digital watch"), [keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard "Computer keyboard"), and [tablet computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer "Tablet computer"), have interfaces for use as computer peripheral devices.
