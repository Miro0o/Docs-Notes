## Iceweasel

Iceweasel is a rebranding of Mozilla Firefox. It is essentially Firefox but without the non-free components such as images and plug-ins. The rebranding is currently taking place as two independent projects. One is part of the Gnuzilla project, a GNU project to provide versions of Mozilla programs using entirely free software. The other is a rebranded build prepared by Debian. The two projects might merge in the future.

Warning: Please be advised if you have a bug in Iceweasel, because it is not provided by a supported Ubuntu repository, the Ubuntu project is unable to provide support or a fix. If you want support, you may want to use firefox.1
