# ☄️ Trouble shooting

## 👉after running `brew doctor`...

```shell
Warning:Unbrewed '.pc' files were found in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.
If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when
building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.

Unexpected '.pc' files:
  /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/tcl.pc
  /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/tk.pc

Warning: Unbrewed static libraries were found in /usr/local/lib.
If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when
building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.

Unexpected static libraries:
  /usr/local/lib/libtclstub8.6.a
  /usr/local/lib/libtkstub8.6.a

Warning: Broken symlinks were found. Remove them with `brew cleanup`:
  /usr/local/bin/subl
  
```

[Solusion #1](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125853/homebrew-doctor-warnings-requesting-library-deletions)

+ it says that the `.pc` file belongs to R studio(?). and the workaround is as given.

## 👉 [brew 下载中断](https://blog.csdn.net/lhp171302512/article/details/122810869)

for instance, when i was downloading `php@8.0` from brew: 

```shell
curl: (35) error:02FFF036:system library:func(4095):Connection reset by peer

Error: php@8.0: Failed to download resource "sqlite_bottle_manifest"
Download failed: https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/sqlite/manifests/3.38.2
```

one solution here is to download the required file manually and replace it form the brew cache folder to cheat brew to continue downloading.



## 👉  [Reset Homebrew Formula](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9369519/reset-homebrew-formula)

The update-reset version of this command resets all formulae to be identical to the contents of their remote repositories, deleting any local changes. It is only used as a last-resort effort to fix a problem (it’s like unplugging Homebrew and plugging it back in).

   ```shell
   Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
   an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
   are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
   may have crashed in this repository earlier:
   remove the file manually to continue.
