yabai is a window management utility that is designed to work as an extension to the built-in window manager of macOS. yabai allows you to control your windows, spaces and displays freely using an intuitive command line interface and optionally set user-defined keyboard shortcuts using [↗ skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) and other third-party software.

- The [↗ yabai wiki](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki) has both brief and detailed installation instructions for multiple installation methods, and also explains how to uninstall yabai completely.
- Sample configuration files can be found in the [↗ examples](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/tree/master/examples) directory. Refer to the [↗ documentation](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/blob/master/doc/yabai.asciidoc) or the wiki for further information.
- Keyboard shortcuts can be defined with [↗ skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) or any other suitable software you may prefer.
- Use [↗stackline](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline) to visualize yabai window stacks on macOS. Works with yabai & hammerspoon.
