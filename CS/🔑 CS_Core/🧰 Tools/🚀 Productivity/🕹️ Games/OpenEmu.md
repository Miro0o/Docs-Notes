[OpenEmu](http://openemu.org/) is a *free* (you can donate if you like their software) and open source graphical front end for many software emulators (which in turn are also open source). OpenEmu makes it exceedingly easy to get you up and running your favorite older generation titles from a multitude of systems such as Atari, Nintendo, Sega and even arcade systems.

OpenEmu is available online at the [OpenEmu website](http://openemu.org/).

An "experimental" release containing a strictly unsupported core plugin for Arcade systems is also available. Both releases can be downloaded from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/releases).

See the [User guide](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide) for usage documentation.



## Getting OpenEmu

OpenEmu comes in two flavors. Press Pack and an OpenEmu Experimental Press Pack. The only difference as far as I can tell is that the Press Pack is lacking support for the M.A.M.E., which is arcade machine emulation software.



### What is M.A.M.E.

For simplicity's sake, I'll define M.A.M.E. as an archive of the vintage software that runs arcade systems from yesteryear. The developers try their best to recreate the software systems that ran/run on arcade based computers and do so strictly via CPU emulation for that purpose. The developers avoid using GPU acceleration for the emulation because the actual running of the software is simply an aside to the purpose of their mission. As a result, if you want to run some older arcade games, aside from having an authentic arcade CPU board, your best option would be the M.A.M.E. project.

## Retrogaming

Retrogaming, also known as classic gaming and old school gaming, is the playing or collecting of older [personal computer](Computer_game.html), [console](Video_game_console.html), and [arcade](Arcade_game.html) video games in contemporary times. Usually retrogaming is based upon systems that are obsolete or discontinued. Retrogaming has three main types; vintage retrogaming, retrogaming emulation, and ported retrogaming. Vintage retrogaming includes games that are played on the original hardware. [Emulation](Emulator.html) involves newer systems simulating old gaming systems, while ported retrogaming allows games to be played on modern hardware via [ports](Porting.html) or compilations. Participants in the hobby are sometimes known as retrogamers in the United Kingdom, while the terms "classic gamers" or "old school gamers" are more prevalent in the United States. Similarly, the games are known as retrogames, classic games, or old school games. Retrogaming is often linked to [indie gaming](Indie_gaming.html), which involves current games, though unconventionally published. Additionally, the term could apply to a newer game, but with features similar to those of older games, such as an "retro [RPG](Role-playing_video_game.html)" which features turn-based combat and an isometric camera perspective. Retrogaming has existed since the early years of the video game industry, but was popularized with the popularity of the internet and emulation technology. It is argued that the main reasons players are drawn to retrogames are nostalgia for different eras, the idea that older games can be more challenging, and the simplicity of the games that requires less hours of gameplay.
