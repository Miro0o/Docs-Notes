## Intro
🏠 https://www.dosbox.com

While OpenEmu focuses on classic game consoles, you can also emulate the DOS programs of yore with [DOSBox(Opens in a new window)](https://www.dosbox.com/). It isn't quite as plug-and-play as OpenEmu -- you'll need to do just a bit of that command-line work you did in the actual days of DOS—but for many games, it's pretty simple.


### Getting Games
Some games may work with no extra effort, while others may require tweaking, so check out the [DOSBox compatibility list(Opens in a new window)](https://www.dosbox.com/comp_list.php?letter=a) or look up your games of choice to see what fiddling might be required.
