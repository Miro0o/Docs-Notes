## Intro
**Wine** (originally an acronym for "**Wine Is Not an Emulator**") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, & BSD. Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.

> Crossover is based on Wine and essentially powers it, but it isn't the same, as it adds additional features on top of it specifically to deal with installation and compatibility of Windows applications. It is kind of like PlayOnLinux but optimized for applications. Their work is to improve compatibility with productivity applications, not games. They don't technically support any games to my knowledge. For gaming you would definitely be better off with Lutris and/or Proton. Also note that Codeweavers contributes quite a bit to the Wine project as well, so a lot of what they do it in Wine as well.
