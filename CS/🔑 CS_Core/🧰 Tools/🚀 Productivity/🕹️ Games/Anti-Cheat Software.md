[What Is Vanguard Anti-Cheat Software?]: https://machow2.com/vanguard/

Vanguard is an anti-cheat software created by Riot Games to stop users from cheating in games such as [**Valorant**](https://machow2.com/valorant-for-mac/) and [**Elden Ring**](https://machow2.com/elden-ring-mac/).

The problem this causes for Mac users is that Vanguard does not work in Virtual Machines so if you want to [**install Windows on your Mac**](https://machow2.com/best-way-run-windows-mac/) in a virtual machine such as [**Parallels**](https://machow2.com/parallels-review/) for gaming, it won’t work.

However, Vanguard will work if you install Windows on your Mac [**using Apple’s Boot Camp**](https://machow2.com/windows-11-mac-boot-camp/).

The problem for M1 Macs however is that [**Boot Camp doesn’t work on M1 Macs**](https://machow2.com/windows-on-m1-mac/) which means if you own an M1 Mac there’s no way of playing Windows only games with Vanguard protection.
