Hi! Today is my first day changing to Typora as full-time editor, when previously i used Obsidian as a full-time editor. The stunning concision and elegance and smoothness of the operation of Typoar is the most impulsive reason that pushed me made the adaotion from Obsidian to Typora. So far so good! Though one thing is kind of upset on Typora that it cannot pharse the inner-link between local folders i created like Obsidian does, which leads to a little bit trouble. Idk how to fix it or find an alternative?  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Anyway, if there's no long-term solusion for the inner-link problem, i will change my writing style and stop using inner-link.
