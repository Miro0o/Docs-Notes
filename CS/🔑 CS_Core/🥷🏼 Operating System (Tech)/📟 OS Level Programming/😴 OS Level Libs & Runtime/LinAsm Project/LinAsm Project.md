## Intro
Welcome to Linux Assembly libraries project, which provides very fast and SIMD optimized assembly libraries for common and wide used algorithms.‭ ‬Most of them were specially developed for data analysis and time series processing,‭ ‬but now they implement much more mathematical and general algorithms and abstraction data types (ADT).‭ All of them are reenterable and do not modify any global variables. They are grouped by categories in depending of the tasks they cover.

‬These libraries are completely written in flat assembly language (FASM) for **x86-64‭ ‬Linux**,‭ ‬to be used inside C and C++‭ ‬programs, and‭ ‬make them very fast on that platform. Function names follow GCC name standard. If your programming language understands "C" names syntax, and can link shared libraries (\*.so), then you may use these libraries inside your projects are written in the language you like.
