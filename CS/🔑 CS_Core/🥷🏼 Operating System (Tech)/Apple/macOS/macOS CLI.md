First i didn't assign gid number to new user, instead i append it to `staff` group on mac, which seems to have errors. 

So i assigned a new gid number to the new user (a new group, not `staff`) and set the `PrimaryGroupID` as it. (It seems like that the new user must have its `PrimaryGroupID` as a new gid rather than `staff` ?? ) This step is important because otherwise the new user cannot use `chown`.

After above i create the new user's home directory with sudo and `chown` that directory to new user. `chown  -R user:usergroup /path/to/home/dir`
Then set the home dir as the new user's home `sudo dscl . create /User/username home /path/to/home/dir`

However at this point i cannot `su` to this new user. i then set the password for it as null `sudo dscl . create /User/username passwd '*'` but it didn't work. I tried setting it as not null but didn't work either. 
Then i tried `sudo passwd username`. This worked.
