## Intro

## 🍻 `Homebrew` Basic Usages
### 🍔 Installation
1. [installing command line tools on mac](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/)
	+ 🤔 [[../../../../../../CyberSecurity/Network Security/Anonymous & Private Networks/Proxy/Proxy|using proxy]] to download form official web
	
2.  go to [homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation), run command code.


### 🚮 Uninstall Pcks
#### `brew autoremove`
Ref --> [Uninstall / remove a Homebrew package including all its dependencies](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7323261/uninstall-remove-a-homebrew-package-including-all-its-dependencies)

#### `brew cleanup`
By default, `homebrew` keeps copy file of already installed formulae downloads files around "*In case something goes wrong and you have to reinstall*". 

The [cleanup](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#how-do-i-uninstall-old-versions-of-a-formula) (`brew cleanup`) command will remove outdated installed package versions. To affect a particular package/formula, you may supply a formula name like so: `brew cleanup $FORMULA`. To simulate cleanup, i.e. see what would be removed, you may use the `-n` option: `brew cleanup -n`.

Add following alias in shell config file to simplify process:
```shell
alias brewski='brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup; brew doctor'
```

I end with `brew doctor` to make sure all packages are correctly symlinked, e.g., `awscli` seems to have a problem with this on the regular so I constantly have to unlink/relink. Hope this helps
