## Intro
How to get docs & cheat sheets about a given command? There are a lot!

For built-in support, there are `man`, `info`, `apropos`, etc.
For online cheat sheets, ‚Üó [Cheat.sh](../../../üêö%20Shell/Shell%20Helper/Cheat.sh.md), ‚Üó [explainshell](../../../üêö%20Shell/Shell%20Helper/explainshell.md), ‚Üó [oh-my-zsh](../../../üêö%20Shell/Shell%20Helper/oh-my-zsh.md), and many more!
For emulator support, there are many emulators that integrate AI support for commands how-to, like ‚Üó [warp](../../../üêö%20Shell/Emulator%20|%20Terminal/warp.md)!
