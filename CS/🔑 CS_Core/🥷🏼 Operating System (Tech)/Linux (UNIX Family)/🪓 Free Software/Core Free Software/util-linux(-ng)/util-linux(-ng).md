> util-linux is a random collection of Linux utilities

👉 **util-linux** is a standard package distributed by the  [Linux Kernel Organization](../../🔩 Kernel/🍸 Linux Kernel.md) for use as part of the Linux OS.

👉 A fork, **`util-linux-ng`** (with **`ng`** meaning "next generation"), was created when development stalled, but as of January 2011 has been renamed back to [util-linux](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux), and is the official version of the package.
