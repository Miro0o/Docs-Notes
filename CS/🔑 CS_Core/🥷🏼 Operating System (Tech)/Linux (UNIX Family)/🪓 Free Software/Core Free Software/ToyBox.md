## Intro
> `Toybox` combines the most common Linux command line utilities together into a single BSD-licensed executable that's simple, small, fast, reasonably standards-compliant, and powerful enough to turn Android into a development environment.

**`Toybox`** is a free and open-source software implementation of over 200 Unix command line utilities such as _[ls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls "Ls")_, _[cp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp_(Unix) "Cp (Unix)")_, and _[mv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mv_(Unix) "Mv (Unix)")_. The `Toybox` project was started in 2006, and became a [0BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses "BSD licenses")licensed [BusyBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox "BusyBox") alternative.

`Toybox` is used for **most of Android's command line tools** in all currently supported Android versions, and is also used to build Android on Linux and macOS. All of the tools are tested on Linux, and many of them also work on BSD and macOS
