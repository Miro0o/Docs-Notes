## Intro
Fluxbox is a windowmanager for X that was based on the Blackbox 0.61.1 code. It is very light on resources and easy to handle but yet full of features to make an easy, and extremely fast, desktop experience. It is built using C++ and licensed under the [MIT-License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

Fluxbox is supplied with lots of native options such as **tabbing, grouping, a long list of keycommands, Chainable Keygrabber, fully editable menu and much, much more**. You might want to dive into it and [learn more about fluxbox's features](http://fluxbox.org/features/).
