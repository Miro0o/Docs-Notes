## 👉 [What is SELinux](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux)?
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a [security](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security) architecture for [Linux® systems](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-linux)that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. It was originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as a series of patches to the [Linux kernel](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel) using Linux Security Modules (LSM). 

SELinux was released to the [open source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source) community in 2000, and was integrated into the upstream Linux kernel in 2003.
