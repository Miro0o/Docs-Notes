### My set-up

1. changed theme to sync with mac
2. changed default shell in warp to fish
   1. this needs fish to be on the list of `/etc/shells`
   2. :link: [Using Warp with [zsh|bash|fish]](https://docs.warp.dev/getting-started/using-warp-with-shells)
3. disable session restoring every time warp start up.
   1. tough turned off, this seems to be the default of warp and it seems still stored the session in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/dev.warp.Warp-Stable/warp.sqlite`
   2. :link: [Session Restoration](https://docs.warp.dev/features/sessions/session-restoration)
