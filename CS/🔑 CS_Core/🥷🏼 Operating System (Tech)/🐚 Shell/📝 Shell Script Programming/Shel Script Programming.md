# Shell Script Basics

[TOC]



## Res
📂 [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) --- from LDP (Linux Document Project)

This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, yet progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction . . . all the while sneaking in little nuggets of UNIX® wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation, under the premise that **the only way to really learn scripting is to write scripts**.

This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to programming concepts.
