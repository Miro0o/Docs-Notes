## Intro
> 🔗 https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository

A Debian repository is a set of Debian binary or source packages organized in a special directory tree and with various infrastructure files - checksums, indices, signatures, descriptions translations.

Client computers can connect to the repository to download and install the packages using an [Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt)-based [PackageManagement](https://wiki.debian.org/PackageManagement) tool.


### The Debian Package Management Tools
↗ [Debian-based Package Management](Debian-based%20Package%20Management.md)


### Package lists
To browse the list of Debian packages grouped by category, you can look at the [stable](https://packages.debian.org/stable/), [testing](https://packages.debian.org/testing/), [unstable](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/) and various other lists, or search on the  [packages homepage](https://packages.debian.org/).


### Repository management
- [DebianRepository/Setup](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Setup) - summarizes the process of setting up a Debian package repository 
- [DebianRepository](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository) - Debian package repository 
- [DebianRepository/Format](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format) - Debian package repository format 
- [DebianRepository/UseThirdParty](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty) - Instructions to connect to a third-party repository


### Using a repository
Using a repository is fairly simple: for the official Debian repository open `/etc/apt/sources.list`, insert the line

```shell
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
```

then run 
```shell
apt update
```

(As the root user or using sudo of course). You might also consider to use a URL like: 
- `http://ftp.<CC>.debian.org/debian` to use a location closer to you, network-wise. 
- `http://deb.debian.org/debian` to let a CDN choose the closest mirror to you (more [here](http://deb.debian.org/)) 

For the official Debian repositories this simple procedure is sufficient. The [[SourcesList](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList)] article contains further information about sources.list entries. For other third party repositories, you might want to follow [this excellent guide](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty) to reduce the risk of hosing your system from a carelessly maintained repository.
