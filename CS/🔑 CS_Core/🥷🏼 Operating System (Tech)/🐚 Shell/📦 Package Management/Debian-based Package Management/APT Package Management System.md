# APT Package Management System

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
Much of why Debian is a strong Linux distribution comes from its [package management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager). Everything in Debian – every application, every component – everything – is built into a package. 

There are many [software packages](https://wiki.debian.org/Software) available for Debian – everything from the Linux kernel to games. And their number has been growing with every release. 

The [Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt) (*Advanced Package Tool*) package management system is a set of tools to download, install, remove, upgrade, configure and manage Debian packages, and therefore all software installed on a Debian system.

> 🆚  **apt, apt-get**
> `apt` = **most common used command options** from `apt-get`, `apt-cache` and `apt-config`, which means that `apt` does not include every options form above tools like `apt-get`.
