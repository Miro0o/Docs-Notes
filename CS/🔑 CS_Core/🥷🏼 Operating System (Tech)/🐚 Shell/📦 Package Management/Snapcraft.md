## Intro
Snaps are **Linux app packages** for **desktop**, **cloud** and **IoT** that are simple to install, secure, cross-platform, and dependency-free.

They **update automatically** and typically run within a **confined** and **transaction-based**environment. **Security and robustness** are their key features, alongside being **easy to install**, **easy to maintain** and **easy to upgrade**.

Snaps help **desktop** users effortlessly install and run apps like [Spotify](https://snapcraft.io/spotify) or [Slack](https://snapcraft.io/slack). They help **sysadmins** run servers like [NextCloud](https://snapcraft.io/nextcloud), **developers** to package and distribute their work to the global [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store), and they help everyone build and deploy **IoT** devices running [Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core).

From Linux and maker space tinkerers, to the robotics, automotive and signage industries; from your desktop to a deployment of thousands, snap can handle it.
