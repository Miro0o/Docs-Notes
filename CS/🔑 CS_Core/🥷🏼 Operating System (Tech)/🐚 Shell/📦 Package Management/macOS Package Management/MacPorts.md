## Intro
The MacPorts Project is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the [Mac operating system](http://www.apple.com/macos/). To that end we provide the command-line driven MacPorts software package under a [3-Clause BSD License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), and through it easy access to thousands of ports that [greatly simplify](https://guide.macports.org/#introduction) the task of [compiling and installing](https://guide.macports.org/#using) open-source software on your Mac.

We provide a single software tree that attempts to track the latest release of every software title (port) we distribute, without splitting them into “stable” Vs. “unstable” branches, targeting mainly macOS Catalina v10.15 and later (including macOS Ventura v13 on both Intel and Apple Silicon). There are [**thousands** of ports](https://ports.macports.org/) in our tree, distributed among different categories, and more are being added on a regular basis.
