## Intro
Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.

Sounds boring. Let's try again.

**Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one.**

Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town *or your money back!* With each keystroke in your command prompt, you'll take advantage of the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes. Strangers will come up to you in cafés and ask you, *"that is amazing! are you some sort of genius?"*

Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you have always felt you deserved. ...or maybe you'll use the time that you're saving to start flossing more often. 😬

## Customization
### 🤲🏼 Self-made Script
#### opening prompt
I write this opening prompt for fun. The script is to output an artful text on the screen everytime it is activated. The script is stored in `oh-my-zsh` and is invoked in `~/.zshrc`.

How i configure this: [Colorful Banners With figlet and lolcat](https://blog.victormendonca.com/2019/03/10/colorful-banners-with-figlet-and-lolcat/)
```shell
figlet -w 170 -f ~/.local/share/figlet-fonts/Cosmike.flf 'H e l l o , W o r l d !' | lolcat -a -d 1
```

To manually write a script (plugin) under `~/.oh-my-zsh/plugin` using [Figlet](http://www.figlet.org) & [Lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat). [Figlet Fonts](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts) is also needed as output fonts. Here Cosmike is chosen. 

I also made some tweaks about the parameter. I set `-w 170` as the specific output width, and `lolcat -a -d 1` to add some animation to the output text.
