### Communities
https://www.freedesktop.org/
freedesktop.org hosts the development of free and open source software, focused on interoperability and shared technology for open-source graphical and desktop systems. We do not ourselves produce a desktop, but we aim to help others to do so.

Our loose community of projects mostly produce [software](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/) and/or [specifications](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/).

## Intro
> This page mainly focuses on traditional *GNU/Linux Core tools* & other *free software*.

Check out ↗ [Zsh](../../🐚%20Shell%20&%20Terminal(Console)/🦞%20Shell%20Implementations%20&%20Script%20Programming/Zsh/Zsh.md) or ↗ [iTerm2](../../🐚%20Shell%20&%20Terminal(Console)/Terminal%20Emulators/iTerm2.md) or ↗ [🏫 Missing Semester](../../../../🗺%20CS_Overview/💋%20Intro%20to%20CS/🏫%20Missing%20Semester.md) and their 🔗links at the bottom of the page to find numerous more modern and fancy CLI tools. 🎉
A more general notes at ↗ [Shell & Terminal(Console)](../../🐚%20Shell%20&%20Terminal(Console)/Shell%20&%20Terminal(Console).md)
It is suggested learn everything about shell at ↗ [Bash Builtin Commands](../../🐚%20Shell%20&%20Terminal(Console)/🦞%20Shell%20Implementations%20&%20Script%20Programming/Bash/⛹🏻‍♂️%20Bash%20Builtin%20Commands/Bash%20Builtin%20Commands.md)

Use ↗ [Package Management](../../🐚%20Shell%20&%20Terminal(Console)/📦%20Package%20Management/Package%20Management.md) tools to maximize your productivity! 

Also, don't forget ↗ [🤯 Awesome List](../../../../🗺%20CS_Overview/🕶️%20Awesome%20List/🤯%20Awesome%20List.md) !!

Linux and macOS belongs to UNIX family, hence they share a lot part of the eco, i.e. lots of soteware listed here is also available at unix & macOS. For Unix & macOS exclusive tools, check out their own lists of software at ↗ [macOS CLI Software](../../Apple/macOS%20(Derived%20From%20UNIX%20Family)/🪓%20macOS%20CLI%20Software/macOS%20CLI%20Software.md) and ↗ [UNIX CLI Software](../../UNIX%20Family/🪓%20UNIX%20CLI%20Software/UNIX%20CLI%20Software.md) !

There are some fantastic tools (high chance with a GUI) noted at ↗ [CS_Core /Tools](../../../🧰%20Generic%20Tools/Generic%20Tools.md) as well!

Programming-related software can be found at ↗ [Languages Programming /Tools Chain](../../../👩‍💻%20Programming%20Methodology%20and%20Languages/🛠️%20Programming%20Tools%20Chain/Programming%20Tools%20Chain.md)

Software Engineering related tools are found at ↗ [CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) Tools](../../../../Software%20Engineering/CASE%20(Computer-Aided%20Software%20Engineering)%20Tools/CASE%20(Computer-Aided%20Software%20Engineering)%20Tools.md)

Security related tools are found at ↗ [Kill Chain](../../../../CyberSecurity/☠️%20Kill%20Chain/Kill%20Chain.md)

🥳 Enjoy !!
