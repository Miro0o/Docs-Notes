## Intro
***The Free Software Directory*** (**FSD**, or simply **Directory**) is a project of the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://www.fsf.org/). We catalog useful [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) that runs under free GNU-like systems, not limited to the [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/) operating system and its GNU/Linux variants. Many of those programs also runs on proprietary operating systems which can be used to [replace nonfree software](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Free_software_replacements).

The FSD is made thanks to user contributions and our [stack](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Stack) that consists of [MediaWiki](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/MediaWiki), Debian package repository data, and more. Licenses are verified for each and every program listed in this directory. 

The FSF provides this directory as a service to the free software community. [Please consider donating to the FSF](https://donate.fsf.org/) to help support this project.
