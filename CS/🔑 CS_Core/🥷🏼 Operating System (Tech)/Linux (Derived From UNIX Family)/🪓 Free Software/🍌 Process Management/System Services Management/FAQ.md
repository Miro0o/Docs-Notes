## ðŸ‘‰ Diffence between `systemd-sysctl` and `sysctl`
[`sysctl`](https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/procps/sysctl.8)Â is an administrative tool which provides access to values in theÂ `/proc/sys`Â virtual file system (see alsoÂ [How to set and understand fs.notify.max_user_watches](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/444998/86440)). You can use it to see the current value of a setting:
```
sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches
```

and to change the value:
```
sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
```

[`systemd-sysctl`](https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/systemd/systemd-sysctl.8)Â is a systemd service which loadsÂ `sysctl`Â settings from a number of files during boot. You shouldnâ€™t ever need to invoke or manipulate it directly.

The two tools are complementary:Â `sysctl`Â allows you to try a setting temporarily (the changes it makes donâ€™t persist over reboots), and once youâ€™ve decided on an appropriate value, writing it to a file inÂ `/etc/sysctl.d`Â will ensure thatÂ `systemd-sysctl`Â sets it during boot. Again, seeÂ [How to set and understand fs.notify.max_user_watches](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/444998/86440).
