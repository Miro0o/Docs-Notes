ELF is the standard binary format on operating systems such as Linux. Some of the capabilities of ELF are dynamic linking, dynamic loading, imposing run-time control on a program, and an improved method for creating shared libraries. The ELF representation of control data in an object file is platform independent, which is an additional improvement over previous binary formats.

The ELF representation permits object files to be identified, parsed, and interpreted similarly, making the ELF object files compatible across multiple platforms and architectures of different size. The three main types of ELF files are:Â 
- Executable
- Relocatable
- Shared object

These file types hold the code, data, and information about the program that the operating system andÂ linkage editorÂ need to perform the appropriate actions on these files.
