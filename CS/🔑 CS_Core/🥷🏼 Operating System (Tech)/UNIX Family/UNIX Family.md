### 👴🏿 Traditional UNIX Systems

[VAHA96] uses the term "traditional UNIX" to refer to **System V Release 3 (SVR3), 4.3BSD, and earlier versions**. The following general statements may be made about a traditional UNIX system. 

Traditional UNIX is designed to 
1. run on a single processor;
2. lacks the ability to protect its data structures from concurrent access by multiple processors;
3. Its kernel is not very versatile, supporting a single type of file system, process scheduling policy, and executable file format;
4. The traditional UNIX kernel is not designed to be extensible and has few facilities for code reuse. The result is that, as new features were added to the various UNIX versions, much new code had to be added, yielding a bloated and unimodular kernel.
