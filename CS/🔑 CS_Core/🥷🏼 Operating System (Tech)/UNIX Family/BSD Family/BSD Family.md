# BSD Family UNIX

## Intro
The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) series of UNIX releases have played a key role in the development of OS design theory. 4.xBSD is widely used in academic installations and has served as the basis of a number of commercial UNIX products. It is probably safe to say that BSD is responsible for much of the popularity of UNIX, and that most enhancements to UNIX first appeared in BSD versions.

4.4BSD was the final version of BSD to be released by Berkeley, with the design and implementation organization subsequently dissolved. It is a major upgrade to 4.3BSD and includes a new virtual memory system, changes in the kernel structure, and a long list of other feature enhancements.

There are several widely used, open-source versions of BSD. 
1. FreeBSD is popular for Internet-based servers and firewalls and is used in a number of embedded systems. 
2. NetBSD is available for many platforms, including large- scale server systems, desktop systems, and handheld devices, and is often used in embedded systems.
3. OpenBSD is an open-source OS that places special emphasis on security.

The latest version of the Macintosh OS, originally known as OS X and now called MacOS, is based on FreeBSD 5.0 and the Mach 3.0 microkernel.
