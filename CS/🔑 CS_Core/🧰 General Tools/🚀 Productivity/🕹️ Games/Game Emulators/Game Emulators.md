## Intro
### Retrogaming
Retrogaming, also known as classic gaming and old school gaming, is the playing or collecting of older [personal computer](Computer_game.html), [console](Video_game_console.html), and [arcade](Arcade_game.html) video games in contemporary times. Usually retrogaming is based upon systems that are obsolete or discontinued. Retrogaming has three main types; vintage retrogaming, retrogaming emulation, and ported retrogaming. Vintage retrogaming includes games that are played on the original hardware. [Emulation](Emulator.html) involves newer systems simulating old gaming systems, while ported retrogaming allows games to be played on modern hardware via [ports](Porting.html) or compilations. Participants in the hobby are sometimes known as retrogamers in the United Kingdom, while the terms "classic gamers" or "old school gamers" are more prevalent in the United States. Similarly, the games are known as retrogames, classic games, or old school games. Retrogaming is often linked to [indie gaming](Indie_gaming.html), which involves current games, though unconventionally published. Additionally, the term could apply to a newer game, but with features similar to those of older games, such as an "retro [RPG](Role-playing_video_game.html)" which features turn-based combat and an isometric camera perspective. Retrogaming has existed since the early years of the video game industry, but was popularized with the popularity of the internet and emulation technology. It is argued that the main reasons players are drawn to retrogames are nostalgia for different eras, the idea that older games can be more challenging, and the simplicity of the games that requires less hours of gameplay.
