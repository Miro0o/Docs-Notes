## Intro
**Active Directory**Â (**AD**) is aÂ [directory service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_service "Directory service")Â developed byÂ [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft")Â forÂ [Windows domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_domain "Windows domain")Â networks.Â [Windows Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server "Windows Server")Â [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system")Â include it as a set ofÂ [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing) "Process (computing)") andÂ [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service "Windows service"). Originally, only centralized domain management used Active Directory. However, it ultimately became an umbrella title for various directory-based identity-related services.

A domain controller is a server running theÂ **Active Directory Domain Service**Â (**AD DS**) role. ItÂ [authenticates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication")Â andÂ [authorizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization "Authorization")Â all users and computers in aÂ [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows")domain-type network, assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a userÂ [logs into](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login "Login")Â a computer part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted username and password and determines whether the user is aÂ [system administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator "System administrator")Â or a non-admin user. Furthermore, it allows the management and storage of information, provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy other related services: Certificate Services,Â [Active Directory Federation Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services "Active Directory Federation Services"), Lightweight Directory Services, andÂ [Rights Management Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Rights_Management_Services "Active Directory Rights Management Services").

Active Directory usesÂ [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol")Â (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version ofÂ [Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol) "Kerberos (protocol)"),Â andÂ [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System").

Robert R. King defined it in the following way:

> "A domain represents a database. That database holds records about network services-things like computers, users, groups and other things that use, support, or exist on a network. **The domain database is, in effect, Active Directory**."
