## Res

## Intro
**Network-attached storage** (**NAS**) is a file-level (as opposed to [block-level storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-level_storage "Block-level storage")) [computer data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage "Computer data storage") server connected to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") providing data access to a [heterogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_computing "Heterogeneous computing") group of clients. The term "NAS" can refer to both the technology and systems involved, or a specialized device built for such functionality (as unlike tangentially related technologies such as [local area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network"), a NAS device is often a singular unit).
