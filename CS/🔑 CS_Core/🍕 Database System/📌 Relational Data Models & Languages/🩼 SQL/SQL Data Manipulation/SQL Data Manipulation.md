## Intro
This section looks at the following SQL DML statements:
- **SELECT** – to query data in the database
- **INSERT** – to insert data into a table  
- **UPDATE** – to update data in a table  
- **DELETE** – to delete data from a table

### Literals
Before we discuss the SQL DML statements, it is necessary to understand the concept of literals. Literals are constants that are used in SQL statements. There are different forms of literals for every data type supported by SQL (see Section 7.1.1). However, for simplicity, we can distinguish between literals that are enclosed in **single quotes** and those that are not. 

All nonnumeric data values must be enclosed in single quotes; all numeric data values must not be enclosed in single quotes
