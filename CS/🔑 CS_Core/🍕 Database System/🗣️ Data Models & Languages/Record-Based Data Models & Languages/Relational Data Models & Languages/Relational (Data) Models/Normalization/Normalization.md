# Normalization

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
Normalization is a database design technique that begins by examining the relationships (called **functional dependencies**) between **attributes**. Attributes describe some property of the data or of the relationships between the data that is important to the enterprise. Normalization uses a series of tests (described as **normal forms**) to help identify the optimal grouping for these attributes to ultimately identify a set of suitable relations that supports the data requirements of the enterprise.


### Purpose of Normalization
Normalization is a technique for producing a set of relations with desirable properties, given the data requirements of an enterprise.

Characteristics of a suitable set of relations include:
- the **minimal number of attributes** necessary to support the data requirements of the enterprise
- **attributes with a close logical relationship** are found in the same relation
- ‚≠ê **minimal redundancy** with each attribute represented only once with the important exception of attributes that form all or part of foreign keys.

The benefits of using a database that has a suitable set of relations is that the database will be:
- easier for the user to access and maintain the data
* take up minimal storage space on the computer


### How Normalization Supports Database Design
1. Used as a bottom-up standalone technique
2. Used as a validation technique to check the structure of relations, which may have been created using a top-down approach such as ER modeling

## Data Redundancy & Update Anomalies
### Benifits of Minimal Data Redundancy
If this aim is achieved, potential benefits for implemented database include:
- Updates to the data stored in the database are achieved with a minimal number of operations thus reducing the opportunities for **data inconsistencies**.
- Reduction in the **file storage space** required by the base relations thus minimizing costs.


### Update Anomalies with Redundant Data
#### Insertion Anomalies

#### Deletion Anomalies


#### Modification Anomalies


### Principles of Decomposing
We can avoid these update anomalies by decomposing the original relation into the Staff and Branch relations. There are two important properties associated with decompo- sition of a larger relation into smaller relations:
- The **lossless-join** property ensures that any instance of the original relation can be identified from corresponding instances in the smaller relations.
- The **dependency preservation** property ensures that a constraint on the original relation can be maintained by simply enforcing some constraint on each of the smaller relations. In other words, we do not need to perform joins on the smaller relations to check whether a constraint on the original relation is violated.

### Characteristics of Functional Dependencies
![](../../../../../../../../Assets/Pics/Screenshot%202023-04-22%20at%209.06.11%20PM.png)

**Functional dependency** is a property of the meaning or semantics of the attrib- utes in a relation. The semantics indicate how attributes relate to one another, and specify the functional dependencies between attributes. When a functional dependency is present, the dependency is specified as a **constraint** between the attributes.

When a functional dependency exists, the attribute or group of attributes on the left-hand side of the arrow is called the **determinant**. For example, in Figure above, A is the determinant of B. We demonstrate the identification of a functional dependency in the following example.

#### Full Functional Dependency
An additional characteristic of functional dependencies that is useful for normalization is that their determinants should have the minimal number of attributes necessary to maintain the functional dependency with the attribute(s) on the righthand side. This requirement is called **full functional dependency**.

#### Transitive Dependency
**Transitive Dependency**: A condition where a, B, and C are attributes of a relation such that if a ¬Æ B and B ¬Æ C, then C is transitively dependent on a via B (provided that a is not functionally dependent on B or C).

### üß≠ Inference Rules for Functional Dependencies

How do we begin to identify useful functional dependencies on a relation? Normally, the database designer starts by specifying functional dependencies that are semantically obvious; however, there are usually numerous other functional dependencies. In fact, the task of specifying all possible functional dependencies for ‚Äúreal‚Äù database projects is more often than not impractical. However, in this section we do consider an approach that helps identify the complete set of func- tional dependencies for a relation and then discuss how to achieve a minimal set of functional dependencies that can represent the complete set.

#### Closure of Functional Dependencies
The set of all functional dependencies that are implied by a given set of functional dependencies X is called the **closure** of X, written X+. We clearly need a set of rules to help compute X+ from X. 

#### Armstrong's Axioms
A set of inference rules, called Armstrong‚Äôs axioms, specifies how new functional dependencies can be inferred from given ones (Armstrong, 1974). For our discussion, let A, B, and C be subsets of the attributes of the relation R. Armstrong‚Äôs axioms are as follows:
1. **Reflexivity**: If B is a subset of a, then a ¬Æ B
2. **Augmentation**: If a ¬Æ B, then a,C ¬Æ B,C  
3. **Transitivity**: If a ¬Æ B and B ¬Æ C, then a ¬Æ C

Note that each of these three rules can be directly proved from the definition of functional dependency.
- The rules are **complete** (ÂÆåÂ§áÁöÑ) in that given a set X of functional dependencies, all functional dependencies implied by X can be derived from X using these rules. 
- The rules are also **sound**ÔºàÊúâÊïàÁöÑÔºâin that no additional functional depend- encies can be derived that are not implied by X. In other words, the rules can be used to derive the closure of X+.

#### Further Derived Rules
Several further rules can be derived from the three given previously that simplify the practical task of computing X+. In the following rules, let D be another subset of the attributes of relation r. Then:
4. **Self-determination**: a¬Æa
5. **Decomposition**: f a ¬Æ B,C, then a ¬Æ B and a ¬Æ C
6. **Union**: If a ¬Æ B and a ¬Æ C, then a ¬Æ B,C
7. **Composition**: If a¬ÆB and C¬ÆD then a,C¬ÆB,D


### Minimal Sets of Functional Dependencies
In this section we introduce what is referred to as **equivalence** of sets of functional dependencies. A set of functional dependencies Y is covered by a set of functional dependencies X, if every functional dependency in Y is also in X+; that is, every dependency in Y can be inferred from X. A set of functional dependencies X is minimal if it satisfies the following conditions:
- Every dependency in X has a single attribute on its right-hand side.
- We cannot replace any dependency a ¬Æ B in X with dependency C ¬Æ B, where C is a proper subset of a, and still have a set of dependencies that is equivalent to X.
- We cannot remove any dependency from X and still have a set of dependencies that is equivalent to X.

A minimal set of dependencies should be in a standard form with no redundancies. A minimal cover of a set of functional dependencies X is a minimal set of dependencies Xmin that is equivalent to X. Unfortunately, there can be several minimal covers for a set of functional dependencies.



## The Process of Normalization
Normalization is a formal technique for analyzing relations based on their **primary key** (or candidate keys) and **functional dependencies** (Codd, 1972b). The technique involves a series of rules that can be used to test individual relations so that a database can be normalized to any degree. When a requirement is not met, the relation violating the requirement must be decomposed into relations that individually meet the requirements of normalization.


### Normal Forms
Three normal forms were initially proposed called First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF). Subsequently, R. Boyce and E. F. Codd introduced a stronger definition of third normal form called Boyce‚ÄìCodd Normal Form (BCNF) (Codd, 1974). With the exception of 1NF, all these normal forms are based on functional dependencies among the attributes of a relation (Maier, 1983). Higher normal forms that go beyond BCNF were introduced later such as Fourth Normal Form (4NF) and Fifth Normal Form (5NF) (Fagin, 1977, 1979). However, these later normal forms deal with situations that are very rare.

![](../../../../../../../../Assets/Pics/Screenshot%202023-04-22%20at%209.17.51%20PM.png)

Normalization is often executed as a series of steps. Each step corresponds to a specific normal form that has known properties. As normalization proceeds, the relations become progressively more restricted (stronger) in format and also less vulnerable to update anomalies.

For the relational data model, it is important to recognize that it is only First Normal Form (1NF) that is critical in creating relations; all subsequent normal forms are optional. However, to avoid the update anomalies it is generally recommended that we proceed to at least Third Normal Form (3NF)

#### Unnormalizaed Form (UNF)
A table that contains one or more repeating groups.

#### 1NF
A relation in which the intersection of each row and column contains one and only one value.

#### 2NF
A relation that is in first normal form and every non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

ü§î General Definition: A relation that is in first normal form and every non- candidate-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on any candidate key.


#### 3NF
A relation that is in first and second normal form and in which no non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key.

ü§î General Definition: A relation that is in first and second normal form and in which no non-candidate-key attribute is transitively dependent on any candidate key.

> üí° **General Definitions of 2NF and 3NF**
> 
> When using the general definitions of 2NF and 3NF, we must be aware of partial and transitive dependencies on all candidate keys and not just the primary key. This can make the process of normalization more complex; however, the general definitions place additional constraints on the relations and may identify hidden redundancy in relations that could be missed.
> 
> The trade-off is whether it is better to keep the process of normalization simpler by examining dependencies on primary keys only, which allows the identification of the most problematic and obvious redundancy in relations, or to use the general definitions and increase the opportunity to identify missed redundancy. In fact, it is often the case that whether we use the definitions based on primary keys or the general definitions of 2NF and 3NF, the decomposition of relations is the same.

#### BCNF
A relation is in BCNF if and only if every determinant is a candidate key.

The potential to violate BCNF may occur when:
‚Ä¢ the relation contains two (or more) composite candidate keys or  
‚Ä¢ the candidate keys overlap, that is having at least one attribute in common.
