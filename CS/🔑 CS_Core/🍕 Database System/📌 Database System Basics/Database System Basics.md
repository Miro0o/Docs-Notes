### History of DBMS
1. Manual Management
2. File-Based Systems
3. First-generation Database Systems
	1. Hierarchical and Network  
4. Second generation Database Systems
	1. Relational
5. Third generation Database Systems
	1. Object-Relational  
	2. Object-Oriented


### ✨ Functions & Objectives of a DBMS
* Data Storage, Retrieval and Update
* User-Accessible Catalog 
* ==Transaction Support==
* ==Concurrency Control Services==
* ==Recovery Services==
* Authorization Services  
* Support for Data Communication  
* Integrity Services  
* Services to Promote Data Independence
* Utility Services

#### Database
##### Table



#### System Catalog
The system catalog **consists of tables and views that describe the structure of the database**. Sometimes called the data dictionary, these table objects contain everything that the database knows about itself. Each system catalog table contains information about specific elements in the database.
