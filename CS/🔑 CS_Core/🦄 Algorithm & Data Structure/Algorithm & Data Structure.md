[Algorithms for Competitive Programming](https://cp-algorithms.com)
The goal of this project is to translate the wonderful resource [http://e-maxx.ru/algo](http://e-maxx.ru/algo) which provides descriptions of many algorithms and data structures especially popular in field of competitive programming. Moreover we want to improve the collected knowledge by extending the articles and adding new articles to the collection.


[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.  
  
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
