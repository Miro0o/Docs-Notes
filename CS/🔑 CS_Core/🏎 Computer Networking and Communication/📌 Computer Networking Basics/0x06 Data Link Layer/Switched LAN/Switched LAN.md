LAN 表示 Local Area Network，本地局域网。**一个 LAN 表示一个广播域，含义是：LAN 中的所有成员都会收到任意一个成员发出的广播包。**

上图为最基本的LAN布局。如果设备间想要通讯，必须要获取到对方的MAC地址。
```
举例：A 发信息给 C，A 并不知道 C 的 MAC 地址。
此时通过 ARP 协议（Address Resolution Protocol；地址解析协议；）
获取 C 的 MAC 地址，A 先要广播一个包含目标 IP 地址的 ARP 请求到链接在集线器上的所有设备上，C 接受到广播后返回 MAC 地址给 A，其他设备则丢弃信息。至此已经建立设备间通信的准备条件。
```

链接在集线器中的设备都在同一个**冲突域**和**广播域**中。此时的冲突域就是广播域。简单理解就是在这种布局中，一次只能一台设备发送信号且其他设备都能接受该信号。

集线器是物理层（OSI第一层）设备，主要作用是将信号进行接受-恢复放大-发送，双绞线、光纤在传输信号的时候，随着距离的增大，信号会减弱造成失真，借助集线器可以让信号传播更远的距离；同时集线器上有很多接口，能够扩展终端数量扩大 LAN 的规模。

同一集线器上的所有设备共享带宽，如果设备数量过多的话，会造成链路拥堵，严重的会产生广播风暴(?是吗)。

使用交换机可以把一个大的冲突域划分成多个小的冲突域，这样可以缩减冲突域的范围，降低数据拥堵。

下图添加一个交换机连接几个冲突域，交换机的一个端口对应一个单独的冲突域。这样一来一个大的广播域就分成了多个小的冲突域。但注意的是，这整个网络仍是一个广播域。

上面已经把冲突域进行了隔离，当设备越来越多的时候每个设备都发送一个广播，交换机需要把每个广播复制下发到所有设备，这个开销就很可怕了。

下图我们使用路由器对广播域进行隔离。

当路由器收到广播时，会把它自动丢弃，不会转发到路由器的其他端口，实现了广播域的分割.

## 🧐 Link Virtualization: A Network as a Link Layer
Because this chapter concerns link-layer protocols, and given that we’re now nearing the chapter’s end, let’s reflect on how our understanding of the term link has evolved. We began this chapter by viewing the link as a physical wire connecting two communicating hosts. In studying multiple access protocols, we saw that multiple hosts could be connected by a shared wire and that the “wire” connecting the hosts could be radio spectra or other media. This led us to consider the link a bit more abstractly as a **channel**, rather than as a **wire**. In our study of Ethernet LANs (Figure 6.15), we saw that the interconnecting media could actually be a rather complex switched infrastructure. Throughout this evolution, however, the hosts themselves maintained the view that the interconnecting medium was simply a link-layer channel connecting two or more hosts.

> We saw, for example, that an Ethernet host can be blissfully unaware of whether it is connected to other LAN hosts by a single short LAN segment (Figure 6.17) or by a geographically dispersed switched LAN (Figure 6.15) or by a VLAN (Figure 6.26).

In the case of a **dialup modem connection** between two hosts, the link connecting the two hosts is actually the telephone network -- a logically separate, global telecommunications network with its own switches, links, and protocol stacks for data transfer and signaling. From the Internet link-layer point of view, however, the dial-up connection through the telephone network is viewed as a simple “wire.” In this sense, the Internet virtualizes the telephone network, viewing the telephone network as a link-layer technology providing link-layer connectivity between two Internet hosts.

> You may recall from our discussion of overlay networks in Chapter 2 that an overlay network similarly views the Internet as a means for providing connectivity between overlay nodes, seeking to overlay the Internet in the same way that the Internet overlays the telephone network.

> Frame-relay and ATM networks can also be used to interconnect IP devices, though they represent a slightly older (but still deployed) technology and will not be covered here; see the very readable book [Goralski 1999] for details



## Link Layer Network Virtualization
### Drawbacks in Traditional Link Layer Networks
1. L**ack of traffic isolation**. Although the hierarchy localizes group traffic to within a single switch, broadcast traffic (e.g., frames carrying ARP and DHCP messages or frames whose destination has not yet been learned by a self-learning switch) must still traverse the entire institutional network. Limiting the scope of such broadcast traffic would improve LAN performance. Perhaps more importantly, it also may be desirable to limit LAN broadcast traffic for security/privacy reasons. For example, if one group contains the company’s executive management team and another group contains disgruntled employees running Wireshark packet sniffers, the network manager may well prefer that the executives’ traffic never even reaches employee hosts. This type of isolation could be provided by replacing the center switch in Figure 6.15 with a router. We’ll see shortly that this isolation also can be achieved via a switched (layer 2) solution.
2. **Inefficient use of switches**. If instead of three groups, the institution had 10 groups, then 10 first-level switches would be required. If each group were small, say less than 10 people, then a single 96-port switch would likely be large enough to accommodate everyone, but this single switch would not provide traffic isolation.
3. **Managing users**. If an employee moves between groups, the physical cabling must be changed to connect the employee to a different switch in Figure 6.15. Employees belonging to two groups make the problem even harder.
