SecureCRT client for [Windows](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/windows_capabilities_features.html "SecureCRT SSH client for Windows"), [Mac](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/mac_capabilities_features.html "SecureCRT SSH client for macOS"), and [Linux](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/linux_capabilities_features.html "SecureCRT SSH client for Linux") provides rock-solid [terminal emulation](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/secure_terminal_emulation.html) for computing professionals, raising productivity with advanced [session management](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/session_management.html) and a host of ways to save time and streamline repetitive tasks. SecureCRT provides [secure remote access](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/remote_access_software.html), [file transfer](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/ssh_file_transfer.html), and [data tunneling](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/data_tunneling.html) for everyone in your organization.

Whether you are replacing Telnet or Terminal, or need a more capable secure remote access tool, SecureCRT is an application you can live in all day long. With the solid security of SSH, extensive session management, and advanced scripting, SecureCRT will help raise your productivity to the nth degree.


### Key Benefits
- **Securely access business applications on UNIX, Linux, or VMS** from machines running Windows, Linux, and [Mac](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/mac_capabilities_features.html) — employ the rich emulation support for [VT100](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/terminal_emulation_vt100.html)/[102](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/terminal_emulation_vt102.html)/[220](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/terminal_emulation_vt220.html), TN3270, ANSI, SCO ANSI, Wyse 50/60, Xterm, and Linux console.

- **Configure, manage, and organize** all your sessions with full control over scrollback, [key mappings](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/key_mapping.html), colors, fonts, and more — whether you have one or thousands of sessions.

- **Access your full array of network devices from one client** with SSH ([SSH2](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/securecrt_ssh2.html), SSH1), Telnet, [Telnet/TLS](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/securecrt_tls.html), serial, RDP (Windows only), and other protocols.

- **Leverage the high-productivity GUI** with time-saving capabilities including multi-session launch, [tabbed sessions](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/tabbed_sessions.html), tab groups, [tiled sessions](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/tiling.html), cloned sessions, a [button bar](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/customizable_button_bar.html)and Command Manager for repeated commands, and [mapped keys](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/custom_key_mapping.html).

- Depend on the **open standard [Secure Shell (SSH)](https://www.vandyke.com/solutions/ssh_overview/index.html) protocol** for encrypted logon and session data, flexible authentication options, and optional FIPS 140-2 -approved ciphers.

- **Automate repetitive tasks** in SecureCRT by running [scripts](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/scripts.html) using VBScript, [JScript](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/jscript.html), [PerlScript](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/perlscript.html), or [Python](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/python_script.html). The [script recorder](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/task_automation_script_recorder.html) builds your keystrokes into a VBScript or Python script.

- Implement **smart cards** for highly secure, two-factor authentication. SecureCRT supports X.509 smart cards (PIV/CAC) with the ability to select a specific certificate to be used for public-key authentication.

- **Transfer files between network devices** with SFTP, Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem, or Kermit. A built-in [TFTP server](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/built_in_tftp_server.html) provides additional file transfer flexibility.

- Save steps with the **close integration of SecureCRT and the SecureFX**® [file transfer client](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securefx/index.html), which share sessions and settings that let you run SFTP, FTPS (FTP/TLS), HTTPS (WebDAV and Amazon S3), SCP, FTP, and HTTP file transfer sessions without reentering passwords.
