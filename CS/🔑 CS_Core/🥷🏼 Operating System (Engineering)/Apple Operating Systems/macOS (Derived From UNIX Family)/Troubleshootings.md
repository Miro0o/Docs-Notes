## üëâüëâ AXVisualSupportAgent taking up to much memory
#macos 

This have bothered me for several times. First i found it was eating my ram a couple times, then today it seemed to cause my mac crack down for a while (i had to reboot to get things back to work) which is just putting me on the edge of my endurance. 

After a little research this process seems have something to do with the Accessibility Control on Mac, voice control and zoom function specifically. Because idk specifically the machanism of the process, i did the following according to anwsers listed at the end:

1. shut down the whole voice control system, including Siri and dictation
2. turn off zoom function (sooth image as well as it is metioned in the answser post)

**What is WindowServer on MAC**
[WindowServer on Mac](https://iboysoft.com/wiki/windowserver-mac.html) is responsible for window management. It serves as a connection between your applications and your display. It reflects the application's behavior on your screen, which means whatever you want the application to do, WindowServer demonstrates the graphics that you see on the display. 

In another word, **whatever you see on your screen, was put there by the WindowServer process**. Every time you launch an app, open a new window, or play a game, WindowServer is actively redrawing your screen.

The WindowServer process gets activated the moment you log into your Mac, and it will stop running once you log out. Since it is a core macOS process, this means that it plays an important role in the system, and force-killing WindowServer will result in some serious consequences.

**Why WindowServer taking high CPU**
As we've said, WindowServer draws all the graphical elements and keeps track of all the changes for window positioning, desktop icons, fonts, Spaces, animations, visual effects, etc. It's also responsible for all the external displays.

Therefore, a few things can cause **WindowServer to use so many CPU cycles**. Normally, these include:

- Applications misbehaving
- Having multiple displays
- A desktop cluttered with icons (each of these has to be redrawn every time the screen contents change)
- Older Macs that are running the most recent version of macOS and struggling with some visual effects.

**Steps to improve performance**
As qutoed, the real reason behind this problem is at a high chance google chrome. Despite this, though, below lists some steps to reduce windowserver process workload.

1. Anti-virus & malicious softwraes scanning 
2. reset NVRAM/PRAM (though this step's ligitity is questionable )
3. re-install the latest macOS
4. turnoff the second prompt of the clock in menu bar
5. change the desktop backgroud to a solid color (to reduce the redering effort ??)
6. System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce transparency & Differenciate without color
7. System Preferences > Mission Control > disable Displays have separate Spaces (were no external monitor being used)

### WindowServer is taking up too much memory
I found root cause of this problem. It is Dell Display Manager app which I used to manage screens and windows. When I close this app permanently this problem never came back.

## üëâ Safari opening new tabs slow
#safari #macos 


> üîó https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/e316xk/slow_new_tab_in_safari_13/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

I solved this by making a new tab or new page open 'Empty Page' - from Sarari--> Preferences --> General menu. I think I had a lot of favourites and when a new tab opened with 'Favourites', that really was slowing things down. Opening with 'Empty Page' made it lightning fast.

I previously tried other things like deleting cache, preferences, etc. and that didn't work for me.

## üëâ mtlcompilerservice
#MTLCompilerService #macos 

MTL Compiler Service, better listed as MTLCompilerService, is a compiler for metal shaders, that can pass information directly to the GPU. It was released in iOS 8 as an alternative to using OpenGL. There‚Äôs a variety of performance reasons for the switch, though Apple fully supports use of both currently (with Metal being their preferred route).

Basically it‚Äôs what runs between your application and your GPU/Video Card to speed up graphics processing and makes things prettier.
