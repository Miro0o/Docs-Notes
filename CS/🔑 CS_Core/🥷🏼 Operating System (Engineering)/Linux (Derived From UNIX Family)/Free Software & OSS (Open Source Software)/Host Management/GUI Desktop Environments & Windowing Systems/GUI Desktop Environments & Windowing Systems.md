X11 is a **network protocol**. It encodes things such as graphic primitives, images, pointer motion, and key presses.

Xorg is an **X server**. It implements X11 and provides an interface to keyboards, mice, and video cards.

GTK+ is a **widget toolkit**. It provides things such as buttons, scrollbars, edit boxes, etc.

Metacity and Compiz are **window managers**. They decorate X window primitives and support various operations such as moving, resizing, and maximizing of windows.

GNOME, KDE, and LXDE are **desktop environments**. They provide libraries and specifications that applications use and follow in order to "play nice" with other applications.
