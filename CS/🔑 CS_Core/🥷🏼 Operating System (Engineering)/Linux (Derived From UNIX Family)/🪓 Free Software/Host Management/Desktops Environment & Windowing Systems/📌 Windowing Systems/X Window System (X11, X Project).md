TheÂ **X Window System**Â (**X11**, or simplyÂ **X**) is aÂ [windowing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_system "Windowing system")Â forÂ [bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap "Bitmap")Â displays, common onÂ [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like")operating systems.

X provides the basic framework for a GUI environment: drawing and moving windows on the display device and interacting with a mouse and keyboard. X does not mandate the user interfaceÂ â€“ this is handled by individual programs. As such, the visual styling of X-based environments varies greatly; different programs may present radically different interfaces.

X originated as part ofÂ [Project Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Athena "Project Athena")Â atÂ [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology")Â (MIT) in 1984.Â The X protocol has been at version 11 (hence "X11") since September 1987. TheÂ [X.Org Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Foundation "X.Org Foundation")Â leads the X project, with the current reference implementation,Â [X.Org Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Server "X.Org Server"), available asÂ [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software")Â andÂ [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software")under theÂ [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License "MIT License")Â and similar permissive licenses.
