### Quick Start
If you are new to Debian we recommend you start with the following two guides:
- [Installation Guide](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual)
- [Debian GNU/Linux FAQ](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/)

Do have these at hand when you make your first Debian installation, it will probably answer many questions and help you work with your new Debian system.

Later, you might want to go through these documents:
- [Debian Reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/): a terse user guide, focussing on shell commands
- [Release Notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes): usually published with Debian updates, aiming at users upgrading the distribution
- [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/): official Debian wiki and a good source of information for newcomers



## Intro
Debian, also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported **Debian Project**, which was established by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993. The first version of Debian was released on September 15, 1993, and its first stable version was released on June 17, 1996. The Debian Stable branch is the most popular edition for personal computers and servers. **Debian is also the basis for many other distributions, most notably Ubuntu.**
