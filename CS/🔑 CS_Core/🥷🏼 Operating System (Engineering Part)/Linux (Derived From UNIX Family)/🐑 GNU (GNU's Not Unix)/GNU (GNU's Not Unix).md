[GUN](https://www.gnu.org), (GNU's Not Unix), pronounced as `Guh-NOO`, aka GUN project, is a **free operating system**, using **Linux** and **hurd** as its kernel. 

> GUN is licensed by [GPL (GNU General Public License)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which guarantees its complete freeness in distribution.

GNU is an operating system that is 🔗 [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) — that is, it respects users' freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom.

We recommend [installable versions of GNU](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html) (more precisely, GNU/Linux distributions) which are entirely free software. [More about GNU below](https://www.gnu.org/#More-GNU).

The GNU Project was [launched](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html) in 1983 by Richard Stallman to develop a Free Libre operating system: the GNU operating system. As a result, today it is possible for anyone to use a computer in freedom.

One problem with the article is that it uses the propaganda term “intellectual property” as if that referred to something coherent. The term is such a confusion that talking about it [makes no sense](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html). The article is also somewhat confused in regard to Symbolics. What Stallman did, while still working at MIT, was to write, independently, replacement improvements comparable to the improvements that Symbolics made in its version of the MIT Lisp Machine System.

Here are two postings that Stallman wrote for a bulletin board at Stanford while he was visiting there in May, 1983. They show some of his thinking on the way towards launching the development of the GNU system. They don't use the term “free software”; apparently he had not yet started to put those two words together.

#### (9965) GNU
Main-belt asteroid [(9965) GNU](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=9965), provisionally designated as 1992 EF2, was named after the GNU project in the [Minor Planet Circular 41571](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/2000/MPC_20001111.pdf). The asteroid was discovered at Kitt Peak by Spacewatch on the 5th March 1992.

## 👩🏼‍🏫 Education
> 🔗 <https://www.gnu.org/education/education.html>

Software freedom plays a fundamental role in education. Educational institutions of all levels should use and teach Free Software because it is the only software that allows them to accomplish their essential missions: to disseminate human knowledge and to prepare students to be good members of their community. The source code and the methods of Free Software are part of human knowledge. On the contrary, proprietary software is secret, restricted knowledge, which is the opposite of the mission of educational institutions. Free Software supports education, proprietary software forbids education.

Free Software is not just a technical question; it is an ethical, social, and political question. It is a question of the human rights that the users of software ought to have. Freedom and cooperation are essential values of Free Software. The GNU System implements these values and the principle of sharing, since sharing is good and beneficial to human progress.

To learn more, see the [Free Software definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and our article on [why software should be free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html) (as in freedom).



## 🧐 Philosophy of the GNU Project
*Free software* means that the software's users have freedom. (The issue is not about price.) We developed the GNU operating system so that users can have freedom in their computing.

Specifically, free software means users have the [four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html): (0) to run the program, (1) to study and change the program in source code form, (2) to redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions.

Software differs from material objects—such as chairs, sandwiches, and gasoline—in that it can be copied and changed much more easily. These facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program's users should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer.
