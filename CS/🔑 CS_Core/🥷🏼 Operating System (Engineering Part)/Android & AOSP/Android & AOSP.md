## Intro
Android is an open source software stack created for a wide array of devices with different form factors. Android's primary purpose is to create an open software platform available for carriers, OEMs, and developers to make their innovative ideas a reality and to introduce a successful, real-world product that improves the mobile experience for users.

Android is designed so that there's no central point of failure, where one industry player restricts or controls the innovations of another. The result is a full, production-quality consumer product with source code open for customization and porting.
