## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc

The GNU C Library, commonly known as glibc, is the GNU Project's implementation of the C standard library. It is a wrapper around the system calls of the Linux kernel for application use. Despite its name, it now also directly supports C++ (and, indirectly, other programming languages). It was started in the 1980s by the ↗ [FSF (Free Software Foundation)](../../../../🪪%20Software%20License%20&%20Open%20Source%20(Free%20Software)/Free%20Software%20Organizations/FSF%20(Free%20Software%20Foundation).md) for the GNU operating system.

`glibc` is free software released under the GNU Lesser General Public License. The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system, as well as many systems that use Linux as the kernel. These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt, login, exit and more.
