## Intro
The **Bourne shell** (**`sh`**) is a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) [command-line interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter) for computer [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system).

The Bourne shell was the default [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) for [Version 7 Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix). [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems continue to have `/bin/sh`â€”which will be the Bourne shell, or a [symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) or [hard link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) to a compatible shellâ€”even when other shells are used by most users.

Developed by [Stephen Bourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne) at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs), **it was a replacement for the [Thompson shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell),** whose executable file had the same nameâ€”`sh`. It was released in 1979 in the Version 7 Unix release distributed to colleges and universities. Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter, it was also intended as a [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs.

It gained popularity with the publication of *[The Unix Programming Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment)* by [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike)â€”the first commercially published book that presented the shell as a programming language in a tutorial form.
