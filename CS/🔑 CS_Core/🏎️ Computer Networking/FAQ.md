## ðŸ‘‰ Network, Computer Networks, internet, the Internet, Web, and WWW?

**Network**: vertexes + edges
**Computer Networks**: end hosts + link media
**internet**: a general term referring to a computer network that is interconnected (seen as a single network that is interconnected)

**Internet**: computer networks providing services (Web services, in most cases)
**WWW = Web**: a service of computer networks providing content to every connected end host

> **Tim Berners-Lee** proposed the architecture of what became known as the **World Wide Web**. He created the first webÂ [server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Server), webÂ [browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser), and webpage on his computer at the CERN physics research lab in 1990. In 1991, he announced his creation on the alt.hypertext newsgroup, marking the moment the Web was first made public.
> 
> The system we know today as "the Web" consists of several components:
> - TheÂ **[HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP)**Â protocol governs data transfer between a server and a client.
> - To access a Web component, a client supplies a unique universal identifier, called aÂ **[URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL)**(uniform resource locator) orÂ [URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URI)Â (uniform resource identifier) (formally called Universal Document Identifier (UDI)).
> - **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML)**Â (hypertext markup language) is the most common format for publishing web documents.

### HTTP Pipelining
**HTTP pipelining**Â is a feature ofÂ **HTTP/1.1**Â that allows ==multipleÂ HTTPÂ requests to be sent over a singleÂ TCPÂ connection== without waiting for the corresponding responses

> Pipelining is the process of storing and prioritizingÂ computer instructionsÂ that theÂ processor executes. The pipeline is a "logical pipeline" that lets the processor perform a single instruction in multiple steps. The processing happens in a continuous, orderly, somewhat overlapped manner.

### HTTP Parallel Connection
```xml
 BrowserVersion | ConnectionsPerHostname | MaxConnections
----------------------------------------------------------
 Chrome34/32    | 6                      | 10
 IE9            | 6                      | 35
 IE10           | 8                      | 17
 IE11           | 13                     | 17
 Firefox27/26   | 6                      | 17
 Safari7.0.1    | 6                      | 17
 Android4       | 6                      | 17

 IE Mobile9     | 6                      | 60
```

The first value isÂ **_ConnectionsPerHostname_**Â and the second value isÂ **_MaxConnections_**.

Note:Â **_ConnectionsPerHostname_**Â is the maximum number of concurrent http requests that browsers will make to the same domain. To increase the number of concurrent connections, one can host resources (e.g. images) in different domains. However, you cannot exceedÂ **_MaxConnections_**, the maximum number of connections a browser will open in total - across all domains.Â 

**2020 Update**;
Number of parallel connections per browser:
```xml
| Browser              | Connections per Domain         | Max Connections                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Chrome 81            | 6 [^note1]                     | 256[^note2]                    |
| Edge 18              | *same as Internet Explorer 11* | *same as Internet Explorer 11* |
| Firefox 68           | 9 [^note1] or 6 [^note3]       | 1000+[^note2]                  |

```

- [^note1]: tested with 72 requests, 1 domain(127.0.0.1)
- [^note2]: tested with 1002 requests, 6 requests per domain * 167 domains (127.0.0.*)
- [^note3]: when called in async context, e.g. in the callback ofÂ `setTimeout`, +Â `requestAnimationFrame`,Â `then`...
- [^note4]: of which the last 6 are follow-ups (2,4,6 available at 0.5s,1s,1.5s respectively)
