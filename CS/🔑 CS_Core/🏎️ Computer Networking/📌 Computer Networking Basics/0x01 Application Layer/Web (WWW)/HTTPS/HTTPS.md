## Intro

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure** (**HTTPS**) is an extension of the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) (HTTP). It is used for [secure communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communications) over a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), and is widely used on the Internet.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-2) In HTTPS, the [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) is encrypted using [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as **HTTP over TLS**,[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-3) or **HTTP over SSL**.

The principal motivations for HTTPS are [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) of the accessed [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website), and protection of the [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy) and [integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity) of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), and the bidirectional [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation) of communications between a client and server protects the communications against [eavesdropping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eavesdropping) and [tampering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamper-evident#Tampering).[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-httpse-4)[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-5) The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side [digital certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate). This was historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated HTTPS connections were usually found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured corporate information systems on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). In 2016, a campaign by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation) with the support of [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#cite_note-6) HTTPS is now used more often by web users than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page authenticity on all types of websites; secure accounts; and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing private.
