> This page was largely based on the inventor of SSH, [Tatu Ylonen](https://ylonen.org/) (twitter: [@tjssh](https://twitter.com/tjssh)). He wrote ssh-1.x and ssh-2.x, and still works on related topics. The open source OpenSSH implementation is based on his free version.

## Intro
The SSH protocol uses encryption to secure the connection between a client and a server. All user authentication, commands, output, and file transfers are encrypted to protect against attacks in the network. For details of how the SSH protocol works, see the [protocol page](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/). To understand the SSH File Transfer Protocol, see the [SFTP](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/sftp) page.

### ðŸš€ Quick-Start
```ssh
# copy local ssh public key to target host's ~/.ssh/authoried.host

ssh-copy-id <use_name>@<ip>


```



## Running & Configuring SSH

## Security of SSH and attacks against it
The SSH protocol is believed to be secure against cryptographic attacks on the network, provided keys and credentials are properly managed. However, we do not recommend using `diffie-hellman-group1-sha1` key exchange. It uses a 768 bit Diffie-Hellman group, which may be breakable by governments today. Larger groups are probably ok. Recent OpenSSH versions have disabled this group by default. See [sshd_config](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/sshd_config) for configuring what key exchanges to use.

## Automate with SSH keys, but manage them
SSH keys can be used to automate access to servers. They are commonly used in scripts, backup systems, configuration management tools, and by developers and sysadmins. They also provide single sign-on, allowing the user to move between his/her accounts without having to type a password every time. This works even across organizational boundaries, and is highly convenient.

However, unmanaged SSH keys can become a major risk in larger organizations.

The [PrivX On-Demand Access Manager](https://www.ssh.com/products/privx/) can be used as an alternative for SSH keys, eliminating the need for permanent keys and passwords on servers entirely.
