X.25 is an ITU-T standard protocol suite for packet-switched data communication in wide area networks (WAN). It was originally defined by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and finalized in a publication known as The Orange Book in 1976.

X.25 was preceded by the Arpanet Host and IMP protocols (1970-72) and developed concurrently with the Transmission Control Protocol (1974-1976). This makes it one of the oldest packet-switching communication protocols available; it was developed several years before the OSI Reference Model (1984). The protocol suite is designed as three conceptual layers, which correspond closely to the lower three layers of the seven-layer OSI model. It also supports functionality not found in the OSI network layer.

Networks using X.25 were popular during the late 1970s and 1980s with telecommunications companies and in financial transaction systems such as automated teller machines. An X.25 WAN consists of packet-switching exchange (PSE) nodes as the networking hardware, and leased lines, plain old telephone service connections, or ISDN connections as physical links. However, most users have moved to Internet Protocol (IP) systems instead. X.25 was used up to 2015 (e.g. by the credit card payment industry) and is still used by aviation, purchasable from telecoms companies. X.25 was also available in niche applications such as Retronet that allow vintage computers to use the Internet.
