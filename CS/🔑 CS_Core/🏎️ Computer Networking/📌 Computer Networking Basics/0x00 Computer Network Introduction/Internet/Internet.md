The **Internet** (or **internet**) is the **global system of interconnected [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) that uses the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices**. It is a *[network of networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking)* that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and [optical networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_networking) technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) documents and [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) (WWW), [electronic mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email), [telephony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_telephony), and [file sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing).

The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. 

- The overreaching definitions of the two principal [name spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_space) in the Internet, the [Internet Protocol address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) (IP address) space and the [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) are directed by a maintainer organization, **the [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Corporation_for_Assigned_Names_and_Numbers) (ICANN)**.
- The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the **[Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF)**, a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.
