## Administrative Issues
### Network Neutrality
2015 US FCC Order on Protecting and Promoting an Open Internet: three “clear, bright line” rules:
- **no blocking** … “shall not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices, subject to reasonable network management.”
- **no throttling**  … “shall not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of Internet content, application, or service, or use of a non-harmful device, subject to reasonable network management.”
- **no paid prioritization**. … “shall not engage in paid prioritization”


### ISP: telecommunications or information service?

Is an ISP a “telecommunications service” or an “information service” provider?
- the answer really matters from a regulatory standpoint!

US Telecommunication Act of 1934 and 1996:
- Title II: imposes “common carrier duties” on telecommunications services: reasonable rates, non-discrimination and requires regulation
- Title I: applies to information services:
	- no common carrier duties (not regulated)
	- but grants FCC authority  “… as may be necessary in the execution of its functions”4
