# output Ports (Transmitting)

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
An output port stores packets 
1. received from the switching fabric and 
2. transmits these packets on the outgoing link by performing the necessary link-layer and physical-layer functions. 

When a link is **bidirectional** (that is, carries traffic in both directions), an output port will typically be paired with the input port for that link on the same line card.

Output port processing, shown in Figure 4.7, takes packets that have been stored in the output portâ€™s memory and transmits them over the output link. This includes 
1. **selecting** (i.e., **scheduling**) and **de-queueing** packets for transmission;
2. performing the needed link-layer and physical-layer transmission functions;
