### Computational Complexity
What is the computational complexity of this algorithm? That is, given n nodes (not counting the source), how much computation must be done in the worst case to find the least-cost paths from the source to all destinations? In the first iteration, we need to search through all n nodes to determine the node, w, not in N" that has the minimum cost. In the second iteration, we need to check n - 1 nodes to determine the minimum cost; in the third iteration n - 2 nodes, and so on. Overall, the total number of nodes we need to search through over all the iterations is n(n + 1)/2, and thus we say that the preceding implementation of the LS algorithm has worst-case complexity of order n squared: O(n2). (A more sophisticated implementation of this algorithm, using a data structure known as a heap, can find the minimum in line 9 in logarithmic rather than linear time, thus reducing the complexity.)


### Oscillations

What can be done to prevent such oscillations (which can occur in any algo- rithm, not just an LS algorithm, that uses a congestion or delay-based link metric)? One solution would be to mandate that link costs not depend on the amount of traffic carriedâ€”an unacceptable solution since one goal of routing is to avoid highly con- gested (for example, high-delay) links. Another solution is to ensure that not all rout- ers run the LS algorithm at the same time. This seems a more reasonable solution, since we would hope that even if routers ran the LS algorithm with the same perio- dicity, the execution instance of the algorithm would not be the same at each node. Interestingly, researchers have found that routers in the Internet can self-synchronize among themselves [Floyd Synchronization 1994]. That is, even though they initially execute the algorithm with the same period but at different instants of time, the algo- rithm execution instance can eventually become, and remain, synchronized at the routers. One way to avoid such self-synchronization is for each router to randomize the time it sends out a link advertisement.
