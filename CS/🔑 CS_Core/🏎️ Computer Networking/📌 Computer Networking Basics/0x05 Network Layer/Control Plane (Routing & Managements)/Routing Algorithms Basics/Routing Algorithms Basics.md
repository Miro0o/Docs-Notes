### Routing Alogorithms Taxonomy 
#### Centralized & Decentralized Routing Algorithms
-  A centralized routing algorithm computes the least-cost path between a source and destination using complete, global knowledge about the network. That is, the algorithm takes the connectivity between all nodes and all link costs as inputs. This then requires that the algorithm somehow obtain this information before actually performing the calculation. The calculation itself can be run at one site (e.g., a logically centralized controller as in Figure 5.2) or could be replicated in the routing component of each and every router (e.g., as in Figure 5.1). The key distinguishing feature here, however, is that the algorithm has complete informa- tion about connectivity and link costs. Algorithms with global state information are often referred to as link-state (LS) algorithms, since the algorithm must be aware of the cost of each link in the network. Weâ€™ll study LS algorithms in Section 5.2.1.

-  In a decentralized routing algorithm, the calculation of the least-cost path is carried out in an iterative, distributed manner by the routers. No node has com- plete information about the costs of all network links. Instead, each node begins with only the knowledge of the costs of its own directly attached links. Then, through an iterative process of calculation and exchange of information with its neighboring nodes, a node gradually calculates the least-cost path to a destination or set of destinations. The decentralized routing algorithm weâ€™ll study below in Section 5.2.2 is called a distance-vector (DV) algorithm, because each node main- tains a vector of estimates of the costs (distances) to all other nodes in the net- work. Such decentralized algorithms, with interactive message exchange between neighboring routers is perhaps more naturally suited to control planes where the routers interact directly with each other, as in Figure 5.1.


#### Static & Dynamic Routing Algorithms
A second broad way to classify routing algorithms is according to whether they are static or dynamic. In static routing algorithms, routes change very slowly over time, often as a result of human intervention (for example, a human manually editing a link costs). Dynamic routing algorithms change the routing paths as the network traffic loads or topology change. A dynamic algorithm can be run either periodically or in direct response to topology or link cost changes. While dynamic algorithms are more responsive to network changes, they are also more susceptible to problems such as routing loops and route oscillation.


#### Load-sensitive & Load-insensitive Routing Algorithms
A third way to classify routing algorithms is according to whether they are load-sensitive or load-insensitive. In a load-sensitive algorithm, link costs vary dynami- cally to reflect the current level of congestion in the underlying link. If a high cost is associated with a link that is currently congested, a routing algorithm will tend to choose routes around such a congested link. While early ARPAnet routing algo- rithms were load-sensitive [McQuillan 1980], a number of difficulties were encoun- tered [Huitema 1998]. Todayâ€™s Internet routing algorithms (such as RIP, OSPF, and BGP) are load-insensitive, as a linkâ€™s cost does not explicitly reflect its current (or recent past) level of congestion.
