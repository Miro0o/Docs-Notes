## 2️⃣ Link Access
**Link access**. A **medium access control (MAC) protocol** specifies the rules by which a frame is transmitted onto the link. For point-to-point links that have a single sender at one end of the link and a single receiver at the other end of the link, the MAC protocol is simple (or nonexistent) -- the sender can send a frame whenever the link is idle. The more interesting case is when multiple nodes share a single broadcast link -- the so-called **multiple access problem**. Here, the MAC protocol serves to coordinate the frame transmissions of the many nodes.

## RDT & Error Control
### 3️⃣ Reliable Data Transfer (RDT)

**Reliable delivery**. When a link-layer protocol provides reliable delivery service, it guarantees to move each network-layer datagram across the link without error.

Recall that certain transport-layer protocols (such as TCP) also provide a reliable delivery service. Similar to a transport-layer reliable delivery service, a link-layer reliable delivery service can be achieved with acknowledgments and retransmissions.

- A link-layer reliable delivery service is often used for links that are prone to **high error rates**, such as a **wireless link**, with the goal of **correcting an error locally** -- on the link where the error occurs -- rather than forcing an end-to-end retransmission of the data by a transport- or application-layer protocol. 
- However, link-layer reliable delivery can be considered an unnecessary overhead for **low bit-error links**, including fiber, coax, and many twisted-pair copper links. For this reason, many wired link-layer protocols do not provide a reliable delivery service.


### 4️⃣ Error Control

> A full treatment of the theory and implementation of this topic is itself the topic of many textbooks (e.g., [Schwartz 1980] or [Bertsekas 1991]), and our treatment here is necessarily brief. Our goal here is to develop an intuitive feel for the capabilities that error-detection and -correction techniques provide and to see how a few simple techniques work and are used in practice in the link layer.

**Error detection and correction**. The link-layer hardware in a receiving node can incorrectly decide that a bit in a frame is zero when it was transmitted as a one, and vice versa. Such bit errors are introduced by **signal attenuation** and **electromagnetic noise**. 

Because there is no need to forward a datagram that has an error, many link-layer protocols provide a mechanism to only detect such bit errors. This is done by having the transmitting node include error-detection bits in the frame, and having the receiving node perform an error check. 

> Recall from Chapters 3 and 4 that the Internet’s transport layer and network layer also provide a limited form of error detection -- the **Internet checksum**. **Error detection in the link layer is usually more sophisticated and is implemented in hardware**. Error correction is similar to error detection, except that a receiver not only detects when bit errors have occurred in the frame but also determines exactly where in the frame the errors have occurred (and then corrects these errors).

Generally, more sophisticated error-detection and -correction techniques (that is, those that have a smaller probability of allowing undetected bit errors) incur a larger overhead -- more computation is needed to compute and transmit a larger number of error-detection and -correction bits.

---
Let’s now examine three techniques for detecting errors in the transmitted data
- **parity checks** (to illustrate the basic ideas behind error detection and correction)
- **check-summing methods** (which are more typically used in the transport layer)
- **cyclic redundancy checks (CRC)** (which are more typically used in the link layer in an adapter).
