# CSMA with collision detection (CSMA/CD) 

[TOC]



## Res



## Intro
> Clearly, adding collision detection to a multiple access protocol will help protocol performance by not transmitting a useless, damaged (by interference with a frame from another node) frame in its entirety.

Before analyzing the CSMA/CD protocol, let us now summarize its operation from the perspective of an adapter (in a node) attached to a broadcast channel:
1. The adapter obtains a datagram from the network layer, prepares a link-layer frame, and puts the frame adapter buffer.
2. If the adapter senses that the channel is idle (that is, there is no signal energy entering the adapter from the channel), it starts to transmit the frame. If, on the other hand, the adapter senses that the channel is busy, it waits until it senses no signal energy and then starts to transmit the frame.
3. While transmitting, the adapter monitors for the presence of signal energy coming from other adapters using the broadcast channel.
4. If the adapter transmits the entire frame without detecting signal energy from other adapters, the adapter is finished with the frame. If, on the other hand, the adapter detects signal energy from other adapters while transmitting, it aborts the transmission (that is, it stops transmitting its frame).
5. After aborting, the adapter waits a **random amount of time** and then returns to step 2.


### The Choice of Wait-Time Interval Length
The need to wait a random (rather than fixed) amount of time is hopefully clear -- if two nodes transmitted frames at the same time and then both waited the same fixed amount of time, they’d continue colliding forever. 

But what is a good interval of time from which to choose the random backoff time? 
- If the interval is large and the number of colliding nodes is small, nodes are likely to wait a large amount of time (with the channel remaining idle) before repeating the sense-and-transmit-when- idle step. 
- On the other hand, if the interval is small and the number of colliding nodes is large, it’s likely that the chosen random values will be nearly the same, and transmitting nodes will again collide. 

What we’d like is an interval that is short when the number of colliding nodes is small, and long when the number of colliding nodes is large.

### Binary Exponential Backoff Algorithm
The binary exponential backoff algorithm, used in Ethernet as well as in DOC-SIS cable network multiple access protocols [DOCSIS 3.1 2014], elegantly solves this problem. Specifically, when transmitting a frame that has already experienced n collisions, a node chooses the value of K at random from {0,1,2, . . . . 2n - 1}. Thus, the more collisions experienced by a frame, the larger the interval from which K is chosen. For Ethernet, the actual amount of time a node waits is `K*512` bit times (i.e., K times the amount of time needed to send 512 bits into the Ethernet) and the maximum value that n can take is capped at 10.

Let’s look at an example. Suppose that a node attempts to transmit a frame for the first time and while transmitting it detects a collision. The node then chooses K = 0 with probability 0.5 or chooses K = 1 with probability 0.5. If the node chooses K = 0, then it immediately begins sensing the channel. If the node chooses K = 1, it waits 512 bit times (e.g., 5.12 microseconds for a 100 Mbps Ethernet) before beginning the sense-and-transmit-when-idle cycle. After a second collision, K is chosen with equal probability from {0,1,2,3}. After three collisions, K is chosen with equal probability from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. After 10 or more collisions, K is cho- sen with equal probability from {0,1,2, . . . , 1023}. Thus, the size of the sets from which K is chosen grows exponentially with the number of collisions; for this reason this algorithm is referred to as binary exponential backoff.

We also note here that each time a node prepares a new frame for transmission, it runs the CSMA/CD algorithm, not taking into account any collisions that may have occurred in the recent past. So it is possible that a node with a new frame will immediately be able to sneak in a successful transmission while several other nodes are in the exponential backoff state.


### CSMA/CD Efficiency
When only one node has a frame to send, the node can transmit at the full channel rate (e.g., for Ethernet typical rates are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, or 1 Gbps). However, if many nodes have frames to transmit, the effective transmission rate of the channel can be much less. We define the efficiency of CSMA/CD to be the long-run fraction of time during which frames are being transmitted on the channel without collisions when there is a large number of active nodes, with each node having a large number of frames to send. In order to present a closed-form approximation of the efficiency of Ethernet, let $d_{prop}$ denote the maximum time it takes signal energy to propagate between any two adapters. Let $d_{trans}$ be the time to transmit a maximum-size frame (approximately $1.2 msecs$ for a $10 Mbps$ Ethernet). A derivation of the efficiency of CSMA/CD is beyond the scope of this book (see [Lam 1980] and [Bertsekas 1991]). Here we simply state the following approximation:
$$Efficiency =  \frac{1}{1+5d_{prop}/d_{trans}}$$
We see from this formula that as $d_{prop}$ approaches 0, the efficiency approaches 1. This matches our intuition that if the propagation delay is zero, colliding nodes will abort immediately without wasting the channel. Also, as $d_{trans}$ becomes very large, efficiency approaches 1. This is also intuitive because when a frame grabs the channel, it will hold on to the channel for a very long time; thus, the channel will be doing productive work most of the time.
