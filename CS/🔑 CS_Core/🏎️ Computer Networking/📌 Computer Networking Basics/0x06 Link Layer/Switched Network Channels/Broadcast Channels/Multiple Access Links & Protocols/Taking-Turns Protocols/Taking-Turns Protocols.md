# Taking-Turns Protocols

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
Recall that two desirable properties of a multiple access protocol are 
- when only one node is active, the active node has a throughput of R bps,
- when M nodes are active, then each active node has a throughput of nearly R/M bps. 

The `ALOHA` and `CSMA` protocols have this first property but not the second. This has motivated researchers to create another class of protocols -- the **taking-turns protocols**. As with random access protocols, there are dozens of taking-turns protocols, and each one of these protocols has many variations. We’ll discuss two of the more important protocols here.
