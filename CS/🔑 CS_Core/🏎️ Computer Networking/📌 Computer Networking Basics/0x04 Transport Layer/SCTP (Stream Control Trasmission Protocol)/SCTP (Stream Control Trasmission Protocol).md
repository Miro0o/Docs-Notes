TheÂ **Stream Control Transmission Protocol**Â (**SCTP**) is aÂ computer networking communications protocolÂ in theÂ [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer "Transport layer")Â of theÂ [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite"). Originally intended forÂ [Signaling System 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_System_7 "Signaling System 7")Â (SS7) message transport in telecommunication, the protocol provides the message-oriented feature of theÂ User Datagram ProtocolÂ (UDP), while ensuring reliable, in-sequence transport of messages withÂ congestion controlÂ like theÂ Transmission Control ProtocolÂ (TCP). Unlike UDP and TCP, the protocol supportsÂ [multihoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multihoming "Multihoming")Â and redundant paths to increase resilience and reliability.

SCTP is standardized by theÂ Internet Engineering Task ForceÂ (IETF) inÂ RFCÂ 9260. The SCTP reference implementation was released as part ofÂ FreeBSDÂ version 7, and has since been widely ported to other platforms.
