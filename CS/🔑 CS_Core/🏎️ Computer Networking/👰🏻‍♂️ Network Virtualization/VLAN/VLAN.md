## Intro
In this discussion, weâ€™ve only briefly touched on VLANs and have focused on port-based VLANs. We should also mention that VLANs can be defined in several other ways. 

In MAC-based VLANs, the network manager specifies the set of MAC addresses that belong to each VLAN; whenever a device attaches to a port, the port is connected into the appropriate VLAN based on the MAC address of the device. 

VLANs can also be defined based on network-layer protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, or AppleTalk) and other criteria. 

It is also possible for VLANs to be extended across IP routers, allowing islands of LANs to be connected together to form a single VLAN that could span the globe [Yu 2011]. 

See the 802.1Q standard [IEEE 802.1q 2005] for more details.
