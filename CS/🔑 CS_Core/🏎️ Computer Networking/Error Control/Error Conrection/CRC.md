The [cyclic redundancy check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) (CRC) is based on [division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics)) in the [ring of polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring) over the [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) [GF(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GF(2)) (the integers [modulo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic)), that is, the set of [polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) where each [coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient) is either zero or one, and [arithmetic operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_operations) wrap around.

Any string of bits can be interpreted as the coefficients of a **message polynomial** of this sort, and to find the CRC, we multiply the message polynomial by $$x^n$$ and then find the remainder when dividing by the [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial)-n **generator polynomial**. The coefficients of the remainder polynomial are the bits of the CRC.



## Polynomial arithmetic modulo 2

In general, [computation of CRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_of_cyclic_redundancy_checks) corresponds to [Euclidean division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division) of polynomials over [GF(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GF(2)):

$$M(x)\times x^n = Q(x)\times G(x) + R(x)$$

Here $$M(x)$$ is the original message polynomial and $$G(x)$$ is the degree-n generator polynomial. The bits of $$M(x)⋅x^n$$ are the original message with n![n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b)zeroes added at the end. The CRC 'checksum' is formed by the coefficients of the remainder polynomial $$R(x)$$ whose degree is strictly less than n. The quotient polynomial $$Q(x)$$ is of no interest. Using [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation), it can be stated that:

$$R(x) = M(x) \times x^n \mod G(x)$$

Polynomial addition modulo 2 is the same as [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Bitwise_operation). Since XOR is the inverse of itself, polynominal subtraction modulo 2 is the same as bitwise XOR too.

## Variations

here are several standard variations on CRCs, any or all of which may be used with any CRC polynomial. *Implementation variations* such as [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)and CRC presentation only affect the mapping of bit strings to the coefficients of $$M(x)$$ and $$R(x)$$, and do not impact the properties of the algorithm.

- To check the CRC, instead of calculating the CRC on the message and comparing it to the CRC, a CRC calculation may be run on the entire codeword. 
- The shift register may be initialized with ones instead of zeroes.
- The CRC may be inverted before being appended to the message stream.
