## ðŸ‘‰ Difference between mobile network (or cellular network) and wireless network

A **cellular network** or **mobile network** is a communication network where the link to and from end nodes is wireless. A communication host in a cellular network is often moving instead of staying fixed. 

Whereas in a wireless network, it only implies that the access method in the network is wireless, no matter weather the communicating host is moving or not.
