In computer networking, **Point-to-Point Protocol** (**PPP**) is a data link layer (layer 2) communication protocol between two routers directly without any host or any other networking in between. It can provide loop connection [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication), transmission [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption), and [data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression).

PPP is used over many types of physical networks, including [serial cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_cable), [phone line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_line), [trunk line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunking#Trunk_line), [cellular telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_telephone), specialized radio links, [ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN), and [fiber optic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-optic_communication) such as [SONET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SONET). Since IP packets cannot be transmitted over a [modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem) line on their own without some data link protocol that can identify where the transmitted frame starts and where it ends, [Internet service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) (ISPs) have used PPP for customer [dial-up access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_access) to the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet).

Two derivatives of PPP, **[Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_Ethernet) (PPPoE)** and **[Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_ATM) (PPPoA)**, are used most commonly by ISPs to establish a [digital subscriber line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line) (DSL) Internet service LP connection with customers.
