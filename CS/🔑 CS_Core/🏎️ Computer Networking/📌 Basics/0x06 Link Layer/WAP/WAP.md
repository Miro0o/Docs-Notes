# Wireless Application Protocol, WAP

[TOC]



## Intro



**Wireless Application Protocol** (**WAP**) is a [technical standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard) for accessing information over a mobile [wireless network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network). A **WAP browser** is a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) for [mobile devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device) such as [mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones) that use the protocol. Introduced in 1999,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol#cite_note-1) WAP achieved some popularity in the early 2000s, but by the 2010s it had been largely superseded by more modern standards. Almost all modern handset internet browsers now fully support [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), so they do not need to use WAP markup for web page compatibility, and therefore, most are no longer able to render and display pages written in [WML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Markup_Language), WAP's markup language.

Before the introduction of WAP, mobile service providers had limited opportunities to offer interactive data services, but needed interactivity to support [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) and [Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWW) applications such as email, stock prices, news and sports headlines. The Japanese [i-mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-mode) system offered another major competing wireless data protocol.
