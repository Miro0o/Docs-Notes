## HTTP Conditional Requests
> ðŸ”— https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests

HTTP has a concept ofÂ _conditional requests_, where the result, and even the success of a request, can be changed by comparing the affected resources with the value of aÂ _validator_. Such requests can be useful to validate the content of a cache, and sparing a useless control, to verify the integrity of a document, like when resuming a download, or when preventing lost updates when uploading or modifying a document on the server.


## HTTP Range Requests
> ðŸ”— https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests

An HTTP range request asks the server to send only a portion of an HTTP message back to a client. Range requests are useful for clients like media players that support random access, data tools that know they need only part of a large file, and download managers that let the user pause and resume the download.
