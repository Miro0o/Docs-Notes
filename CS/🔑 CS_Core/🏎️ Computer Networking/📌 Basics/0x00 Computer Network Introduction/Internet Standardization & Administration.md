üìë RFC documents contain technical specifications and organizational notes for the Internet.

- RFCs produced by the IETF cover many aspects of computer networking. They describe the Internet's technical foundations, such as addressing, routing, and transport technologies. RFCs also specify protocols like [TLS 1.3](https://www.ietf.org/blog/tls13/), [QUIC](https://www.ietf.org/blog/innovative-new-technology-for-sending-data/), and [WebRTC](https://www.ietf.org/blog/webrtc-milestone/) that are used to deliver services used by billions of people every day, such as real-time collaboration, email, and the domain name system.

ü•° Only some RFCs are standards. Depending on their maturity level and what they cover, RFCs are labeled with different statuses: Internet Standard, Proposed Standard, Best Current Practice, Experimental, Informational, and Historic.

üè¢ The RFC Series includes documents produced by the

1. IETF
2. the Internet Architecture Board ([IAB](https://www.iab.org/))
3. the Internet Research Task Force ([IRTF](https://irtf.org/))
4. and [independent submitters](https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/independent/). 

All RFCs are published by the [RFC Editor](https://www.rfc-editor.org/), which is the [authoritative source](https://www.rfc-editor.org/retrieve/) for retrieving RFCs.

ü™™ RFCs usually begin as Internet-Drafts ([I-Ds](https://www.ietf.org/how/ids/)) written by an individual or a small group. In the IETF, these are then usually [adopted by a working group](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7721), and improved and revised. Less often, I-Ds are considered within the IETF as ‚Äúindividual submissions‚Äù sponsored by an Area Director. While not every I-D becomes an RFC, a well-defined set of processes (also documented in RFCs) guides the consideration and progression of a document. When they are published, RFCs are freely available online. 

üêû The IETF recognizes that security vulnerabilities will be discovered in IETF protocols and welcomes their critical evaluation by researchers. The[Internet Engineering Steering Group](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/) has provided guidance on [how to report vulnerabilities](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/vulnerabilities/) believed to be discovered in IETF protocols.
