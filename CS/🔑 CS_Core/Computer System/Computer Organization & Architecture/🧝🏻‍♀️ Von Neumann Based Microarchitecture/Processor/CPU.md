Figure 1.1 depicts a simplified Von Neumann based compputer top-level components. 

One of the processor‚Äôs functions is to exchange data with memory. For this purpose, it typically makes use of two internal (to the processor) registers:
- a memory address register (**MAR**), which specifies the address in memory for the next read or write; 
- and a memory buffer register (**MBR**), which contains the data to be written into memory, or receives the data read from memory. 

Similarly:
- an I/O address register (**I/OAR**) specifies a particular I/O device. 
- an I/O buffer register (**I/OBR**) is used for the exchange of data between an I/O module and the processor.
