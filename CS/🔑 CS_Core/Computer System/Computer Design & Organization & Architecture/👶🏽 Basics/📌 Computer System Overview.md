## 📜 ISA

## 🗿 Microarchitecture Models
Control units can be designed in one of two ways: They can be hardwired or they can be microprogrammed. These implement the ISA from design level to real physical machine.

### Harvard Based

> Many modern general-purpose computers use a modified version of the Harvard architecture in which they have separate pathways for data and instructions but not separate storage.
> 
> Pure Harvard architectures are typically used in **microcontrollers** (an entire computer system on a chip), such as those found in embedded systems, as in appliances, toys, and cars.
