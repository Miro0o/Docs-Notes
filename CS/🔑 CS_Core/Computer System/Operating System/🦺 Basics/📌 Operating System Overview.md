## 🥅 OS Objectives & Functions
An OS is a program that controls the execution of application programs, and acts as an interface between applications and the computer hardware. It can be thought of as having three objectives:

- **Convenience**: An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.  
- **Efficiency**: An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.
- **Ability to evolve**: An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing, and introduction of new system functions with- out interfering with service.

🤔 As an engineering project, ↗ **[Fualt Tolerance](Fualt%20Tolerance.md)** is also an eternal objective pursuing by generations of engineers.

#### Traditional UNIX Systems

The description in this subsection has dealt with what might be termed tra- ditional UNIX systems; [VAHA96] uses this term to refer to System V Release 3 (SVR3), 4.3BSD, and earlier versions. The following general statements may be made about a traditional UNIX system. It is designed to run on a single processor, and lacks the ability to protect its data structures from concurrent access by multiple processors. Its kernel is not very versatile, supporting a single type of file system, process schedul- ing policy, and executable file format. The traditional UNIX kernel is not designed to be extensible and has few facilities for code reuse. The result is that, as new features were added to the various UNIX versions, much new code had to be added, yielding a bloated and unmodular kernel.
