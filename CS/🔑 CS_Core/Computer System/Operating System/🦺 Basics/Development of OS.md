[DENN80a] proposes that there have been four major theoretical advances in the development of operating systems:

- Processes
- Memory management
- Information protection and security
- Scheduling and resource management

Each advance is characterized by principles, or abstractions, developed to meet difficult practical problems. Taken together, these four areas span many of the key design and implementation issues of modern operating systems.
