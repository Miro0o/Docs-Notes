## WHAT'S RYU?

**Ryu** is a component-based software defined networking framework. Ryu provides software components with well defined API that make it easy for developers to create new network management and control applications. Ryu supports various protocols for managing network devices, such as [**OpenFlow**](https://www.opennetworking.org/), **Netconf**, **OF-config**, etc. About OpenFlow, Ryu supports fully 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and Nicira Extensions. All of the code is freely available under the Apache 2.0 license.

Ryu means "flow" in Japanese. Ryu is pronounced ["ree-yooh"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ja-Ryu.oga).

 

## INSTALLATION IS A SNAP

Using **pip** command is the easiest option:

```shell
pip install ryu
```

If you prefer to install from the source code:

```shell
git clone git://github.com/osrg/ryu.git % cd ryu; python ./setup.py install 
```
