## Quotes

A handful of dark net search engines that do index .onion sites include [NotEvil](https://hss3uro2hsxfogfq.onion.to/), [Ahmia](http://msydqstlz2kzerdg.onion/), [Candle](http://gjobqjj7wyczbqie.onion/), and [Torch](http://xmh57jrzrnw6insl.onion/). There are also directories like [dark.fail](https://dark.fail/).

Reddit is also a valuable resource for finding the dark net or deep website you’re looking for. Try the /r/deepweb, /r/onions, and /r/Tor subreddits.

Always exercise extreme caution when using publicly posted onion URLs. If you can’t get a personal recommendation from someone you trust, verify the URL from multiple different sources.

## DN & Tor

For many, Tor is synonymous with the [dark web](https://www.avast.com/c-dark-web) — the unindexed part of the internet that’s only accessible with certain browsers. The connection between Tor and the dark web started with the [Silk Road, the first dark web market](https://www.avast.com/c-silk-road-dark-web-market) where customers could buy drugs and other illegal goods. When in operation, the notorious online marketplace could only be accessed through Tor.

As a browser that enables anonymity to both website hosts and visitors, the appeal of Tor to dark web participants is obvious. And though the dark web is not just a haven for illicit activity, accessing the dark web via the onion browser is popular with criminals.

But Tor was not designed with criminality in mind, or intended to be the “dark web browser.” Tor is a legitimate and effective online privacy tool that’s used by a variety of users who value their online privacy and data security.



Some dark web browsers besides Tor:

- **Subgraph OS:** This open-source operating system is designed to be resistant to surveillance and other snoops. It’s been mentioned by whistleblower Edward Snowden as showing potential.
- **Firefox:** Though this popular and accessible browser can access the dark web, it lacks safety features.
- **Waterfox:** Based on Firefox, the Waterfox browser is fast and features tracking protection to safeguard your privacy.
- **I2P - Invisible Internet Project:** Similar to Tor, this is a fully-encrypted, private network layer.
