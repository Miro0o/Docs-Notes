**Tor (The Onion Router) is a network that anonymizes web traffic to provide truly private web browsing.**  The Tor Browser hides your IP address and browsing activity by redirecting web traffic through a series of different routers known as nodes. Because Tor hides browsing activity and blocks tracking, it’s used by whistleblowers, journalists, and others who want to protect their privacy online.
