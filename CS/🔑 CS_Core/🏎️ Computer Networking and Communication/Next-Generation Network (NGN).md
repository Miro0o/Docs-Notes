TheÂ **next-generation network**Â (**NGN**) is a body of key architectural changes inÂ [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication")Â [core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_network "Core network")Â andÂ [access networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_network "Access network"). The general idea behind the NGN is that one network transports all information and services (voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating these into IPÂ [packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet "Network packet"), similar to those used on theÂ [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). NGNs are commonly built around theÂ [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol"), and therefore the termÂ **all IP**Â is also sometimes used to describe the transformation of formerly telephone-centric networks toward NGN.

NGN is a different concept fromÂ [Future Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Internet "Future Internet"), which is more focused on the evolution of Internet in terms of the variety and interactions of services offered.
