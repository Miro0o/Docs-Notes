## Intro
1.  [**SSL Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-socket-layer-ssl/)¬†**:**¬†
    - SSL Protocol stands for Secure Sockets Layer protocol, which is an encryption-based Internet security protocol that protects confidentiality and integrity of data.
    - SSL is used to ensure the privacy and authenticity of data over the internet.
    - SSL is located between the application and transport layers.
    - At first, SSL contained security flaws and was quickly replaced by the first version of TLS that‚Äôs why SSL is the predecessor of the modern TLS encryption.
    - TLS/SSL website has ‚ÄúHTTPS‚Äù in its URL rather than ‚ÄúHTTP‚Äù.
    - SSL is divided into three sub-protocols: the Handshake Protocol, the Record Protocol, and the Alert Protocol.

2.  [**TLS Protocol**](https://write.geeksforgeeks.org/post/3143483)¬†**:**
    - Same as SSL, TLS which stands for Transport Layer Security is widely used for the privacy and security of data over the internet.
    - TLS uses a pseudo-random algorithm to generate the master secret which is a key used for the encryption between the protocol client and protocol server.
    - TLS is basically used for encrypting communication between online servers like a web browser loading a web page in the online server.
    - TLS also has three sub-protocols the same as SSL protocol ‚Äì Handshake Protocol, Record Protocol, and Alert Protocol.

3.  **SHTTP :**¬†
    - SHTTP stands for Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is a collection of security measures like Establishing strong passwords, setting up a firewall, thinking of antivirus protection, and so on designed to secure internet communication.
    - SHTTP includes data entry forms that are used to input data, which has previously been collected into a database. As well as internet-based transactions.
    - SHTTP‚Äôs services are quite comparable to those of the SSL protocol.
    - Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol works at the application layer (that defines the shared communications protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a network) and is thus closely linked with HTTP.
    - SHTTP can authenticate and encrypt HTTP traffic between the client and the server.
    - SHTTP operates on a message-by-message basis. It can encrypt and sign individual messages.

4.  [**Set Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-electronic-transaction-set-protocol/)¬†**:**
    - Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) is a method that assures the security and integrity of electronic transactions made using credit cards.
    - SET is not a payment system; rather, it is a secure transaction protocol that is used via the internet.
    - The SET protocol provides the following services:
        - It establishes a safe channel of communication between all parties engaged in an e-commerce transaction.
        - It provides confidentiality since the information is only available to the parties engaged in a transaction when and when it is needed.
    - The SET protocol includes the following participants:
        - **Cardholder**
        - **Merchant**
        - **Issuer**
        - **Acquire**
        - **Payment Gateway**
        - **Certification Authority**

5.  [**PEM Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/privacy-enhanced-mail-pem-and-its-working/)¬†**:**
    - PEM Protocol stands for privacy-enhanced mail and is used for email security over the internet.
    - RFC 1421, RFC 1422, RFC 1423, and RFC 1424 are the four particular papers that explain the Privacy Enhanced Mail protocol.
    - It is capable of performing cryptographic operations such as encryption, nonrepudiation, and message integrity.

6.  **PGP Protocol :**
    - PGP Protocol stands for Pretty Good Privacy, and it is simple to use and free, including its source code documentation.
    - It also meets the fundamental criteria of cryptography.
    - When compared to the PEM protocol, the PGP protocol has grown in popularity and use.
    - The PGP protocol includes cryptographic features such as encryption, non-repudiation, and message integrity.
