The **Open Systems Interconnection model** (**OSI model**) is a [conceptual model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model "Conceptual model") that 'provides a common basis for the coordination of [ISO] standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection'. In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
