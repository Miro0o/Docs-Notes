> üîó https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network

A **cellular network** or **mobile network** is a communication network where **the link to and from end nodes is wireless**. The network is distributed over land areas called "cells", each served by at least one fixed-location [transceiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transceiver) (typically three [cell sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site) or [base transceiver stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_transceiver_station)). These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data, and other types of content. A cell typically uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed service quality within each cell. 

When joined together, these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area. This enables numerous portable transceivers (e.g., [mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone), [tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer) and [laptops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop) equipped with [mobile broadband modems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_broadband_modem), [pagers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager), etc.) to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and telephones anywhere in the network, via base stations, even if some of the transceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission.
