## Intro
A hybrid routing protocol consists of **characteristics from both, link state and distance vector** routing protocols.

For example, EIGRP can be considered a hybrid routing protocol, as it displays characters of both. As shown below:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Distance Vector**|**Link-state**|
|EIGRP routers only advertise the best route , not every route that is aware of.|An EIGRP router forms neighbour relationships.|
|EIGRP routers do not have a complete network map of the topology, but only what it has been told by its neighbour aka "routing by rumour".|Triggered updates are sent only when a topology change occurs.|
