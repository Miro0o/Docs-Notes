# Link Layer (Tier-2) Switches

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
We‚Äôll see that the switch itself is **transparent** to the hosts and routers in the subnet; that is, a host/router addresses a frame to another host/router (rather than addressing the frame to the switch) and happily sends the frame into the LAN, unaware that a switch will be receiving the frame and forwarding it.

## Properties of Link Layer Switches
Having described the basic operation of a link-layer switch, let‚Äôs now consider their features and properties. We can identify several advantages of using switches, rather than broadcast links such as buses or hub-based star topologies:

- **Elimination of collisions**. In a LAN built from switches (and without hubs), there is no wasted bandwidth due to collisions! The switches buffer frames and never transmit more than one frame on a segment at any one time. As with a router, the maximum aggregate throughput of a switch is the sum of all the switch interface rates. Thus, switches provide a significant performance improvement over LANs with broadcast links.

- **Heterogeneous links**. Because a switch isolates one link from another, the differ- ent links in the LAN can operate at different speeds and can run over different media. For example, the uppermost switch in Figure 6.15 might have three1 Gbps 1000BASE-T copper links, two 100 Mbps 100BASE-FX fiber links, and one 100BASE-T copper link. Thus, a switch is ideal for mixing legacy equipment with new equipment.

- **Management**. In addition to providing enhanced security (see sidebar on Focus on Security), a switch also eases network management. For example, if an adapter malfunctions and continually sends Ethernet frames (called a jabbering adapter), a switch can detect the problem and internally disconnect the malfunctioning adapter. With this feature, the network administrator need not get out of bed and drive back to work in order to correct the problem. Similarly, a cable cut disconnects only that host that was using the cut cable to connect to the switch. In the days of coaxial cable, many a network manager spent hours ‚Äúwalking the line‚Äù (or more accurately, ‚Äúcrawling the floor‚Äù) to find the cable break that brought down the entire network. Switches also gather statistics on bandwidth usage, collision rates, and traffic types, and make this information available to the network man- ager. This information can be used to debug and correct problems, and to plan how the LAN should evolve in the future. Researchers are exploring adding yet more management functionality into Ethernet LANs in prototype deployments [Casado 2007; Koponen 2011].



## 2-Layer Switches (Link Layer Switches) üÜö 3-Layer Switches (Routers)

As we learned in network layer, routers are **store-and-forward** packet switches that forward packets using network-layer addresses. Although a switch is also a store-and-forward packet switch, it is fundamentally different from a router in that it forwards packets using MAC addresses. 

Whereas a router is a layer-3 packet switch, a switch is a layer-2 packet switch. 

> Recall, however, that we learned in Section 4.4 that modern switches using the ‚Äúmatch plus action‚Äù operation can be used to forward a layer-2 frame based on the frame's destination MAC address, as well as a layer-3 datagram using the datagram's destination IP address. Indeed, we saw that switches using the OpenFlow standard can perform generalized packet forwarding based on any of eleven different frame, datagram, and transport-layer header fields.

### Pros & Cons between Switches & Routers
#### Pros & Cons of Switches
First consider the pros and cons of switches.
1. As mentioned above, switches are plug-and-play, a property that is cherished by all the overworked network administrators of the world. 
2. Switches can also have relatively high filtering and forwarding rates -- as shown in Figure 6.24, switches have to process frames only up through layer 2, whereas routers have to process datagrams up through layer 3. 
3. On the other hand, to prevent the cycling of broadcast frames, the active topology of a switched network is restricted to a spanning tree.
4. Also, a large switched network would require large ARP tables in the hosts and routers and would generate substantial ARP traffic and processing. 
5. Furthermore, switches are susceptible to broadcast storms -- if one host goes haywire and transmits an endless stream of Ethernet broadcast frames, the switches will forward all of these frames, causing the entire network to collapse.

#### Pros & Cons of Routers
Now consider the pros and cons of routers. 
1. Because network addressing is often hierarchical (and not flat, as is MAC addressing), packets do not normally cycle through routers even when the network has redundant paths. (However, packets can cycle when router tables are misconfigured; but as we learned in Chapter 4, IP uses a special datagram header field to limit the cycling.) Thus, packets are not restricted to a spanning tree and can use the best path between source and destination.
2. Because routers do not have the spanning tree restriction, they have allowed the Internet to be built with a rich topology that includes, for example, multiple active links between Europe and North America. 
3. Another feature of routers is that they provide firewall protection against layer-2 broadcast storms. 
4. Perhaps the most significant drawback of routers, though, is that they are not plug-and-play -- they and the hosts that connect to them need their IP addresses to be configured. 
5. Also, routers often have a larger per-packet processing time than switches, because they have to process up through the layer-3 fields.
6. Finally, there are two different ways to pronounce the word router, either as ‚Äúrootor‚Äù or as ‚Äúrowter,‚Äù and people waste a lot of time arguing over the proper pronunciation [Perlman 1999].


#### üéØ Choose between Switches & Routers
Typically, small networks consisting of a few hundred hosts have a few LAN segments. Switches suffice for these small networks, as they localize traffic and increase aggregate throughput without requiring any configuration of IP addresses. But larger networks consisting of thousands of hosts typically include routers within the network (in addition to switches). The routers provide a more robust isolation of traffic, control broadcast storms, and use more ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù routes among the hosts in the network.

For more discussion of the pros and cons of switched versus routed networks, as well as a discussion of how switched LAN technology can be extended to accommodate two orders of magnitude more hosts than today‚Äôs Ethernets, see [Meyers 2004; Kim 2008].
