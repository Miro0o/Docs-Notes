## Intro
**Network-attached storage**Â (**NAS**) is a file-level (as opposed toÂ [block-level storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-level_storage "Block-level storage"))Â [computer data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage "Computer data storage")Â server connected to aÂ [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network")Â providing data access to aÂ [heterogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_computing "Heterogeneous computing")Â group of clients. The term "NAS" can refer to both the technology and systems involved, or a specialized device built for such functionality (as unlike tangentially related technologies such asÂ [local area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network"), a NAS device is often a singular unit).
