## Intro
**Content-Security-Policy** is the name of a **HTTP response header** that modern browsers use to enhance the security of the document (or web page). The Content-Security-Policy header allows you to restrict which resources (such as JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc.) can be loaded, and the URLs that they can be loaded from.

- To enable CSP, you need to configure your web server to return the [`Content-Security-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) HTTP header. (Sometimes you may see mentions of the `X-Content-Security-Policy` header, but that's an older version and you don't need to specify it anymore.)
- Alternatively, the [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) element can be used to configure a policy, e.g.
```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; img-src https://*; child-src 'none';" />
```

CSP was first designed to reduce the attack surface of ↗ [XSS (Cross Site Scripting)](../../../../../../../CyberSecurity/Application%20Security/💉%20Web%20Security/🛟%20Web%20Application%20Security%20Risks/Injection/XSS%20(Cross%20Site%20Scripting).md) attacks, later versions of the spec also protect against other forms of attack such as Click Jacking.
