try to pip opencv to my env. after few failed tryouts, it turned out that [opencv is not supported on Python3.8 yet. ](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58918787/16542494) so i piped Python3.6.2 on pythonProject (env name) instead and pip opencv by `conda install -c conda-forge opencv` found on [this website](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv) and it worked out finally. 

now working on [this tutorial](https://new.pythonforengineers.com/blog/image-and-video-processing-in-python/)
