## Intro
> [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) is a fast, light, and simple way to run Docker containers and Linux machines on macOS. You can think of it as a supercharged WSL and Docker Desktop for macOS, all in one easy-to-use app.

### Getting Started
[Download the app](https://orbstack.dev/download) and open it to get started, or follow the [Quick Start](https://docs.orbstack.dev/quick-start) guide.

Switching from Docker Desktop? It's [effortless](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install#replacing-docker-desktop) — no action needed.
