## Intro
### What is Cloud Computing?

> 🔗 https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as **computing power**, **storage**, **networking**, and **databases**, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
