## 🔐 Access

### [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI v2 offers several [new features](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-cli-v2-is-now-generally-available/) including improved installers, new configuration options such as AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO), and various interactive features.

**[Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)**

```shell
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```



###  [AWS Copilot CLI](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli)

**Documentation**: https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/

The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release and operate production-ready containerized applications on AWS App Runner or Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.

Use Copilot to:

- Deploy production-ready, scalable services on AWS from a Dockerfile in one command.
- Add databases or inject secrets to your services.
- Grow from one microservice to a collection of related microservices in an application.
- Set up test and production environments, across regions and accounts.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to release your services to your environments.
- Monitor and debug your services from your terminal.
