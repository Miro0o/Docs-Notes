> An Industrial Grade Federated Learning Framework

FATE implements secure computation protocols based on **homomorphic encryption** and **multi-party computation (MPC)**. It supports federated learning architecture and secure computation of various machine learning algorithms. It open-sourced for the first time in February 2019, and was donated to Linux Foundation in June 2019.

FATE is committed to making the innovation and application of federated learning technology easier!
