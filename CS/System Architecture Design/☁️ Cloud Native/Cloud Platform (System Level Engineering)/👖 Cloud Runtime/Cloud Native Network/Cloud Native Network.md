## Intro
Containers talk to each other and to the infrastructure layer through a cloud native network. [Distributed applications](https://thenewstack.io/primer-distributed-systems-and-cloud-native-computing/) have multiple components that use the network for different purposes. Tools in this category create a virtual network on top of existing networks specifically for apps to communicate, referred to as an **overlay network**.
