## Intro
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a particular technique enabling applications to talk to each other. It's one way of structuring app communication.

Modern apps are composed of numerous individual services that must communicate in order to collaborate. RPC is one option for handling the communication between applications.

RPC provides a tightly coupled and highly opinionated way of handling communication between services. It allows for bandwidth-efficient communications and many programming languages enable RPC interface implementations.
