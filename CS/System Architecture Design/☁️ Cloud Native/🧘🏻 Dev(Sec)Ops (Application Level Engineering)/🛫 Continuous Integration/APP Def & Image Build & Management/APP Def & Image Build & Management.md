## Intro
Application definition and image build is a broad category that can be broken down into two main subgroups. First, developer-focused tools that help build application code into containers and/or Kubernetes. And second, operations-focused tools that deploy apps in a standardized way. Whether you intend to speed up or simplify your development environment, provide a standardized way to deploy third-party apps, or wish to simplify the process of writing a new Kubernetes extension, this category serves as a catch-all for a number of projects and products that optimize the Kubernetes developer and operator experience.
