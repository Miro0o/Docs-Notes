## Intro
The toolset to pack, ship, store, and deliver content.

This repository's main product is the Open Source Registry implementation for storing and distributing container images using the¬†[OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec). The goal of this project is to provide a simple, secure, and scalable base for building a large scale registry solution or running a simple private registry. It is a core library for many registry operators including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, GitLab Container Registry and DigitalOcean Container Registry, as well as the CNCF Harbor Project, and VMware Harbor Registry.
