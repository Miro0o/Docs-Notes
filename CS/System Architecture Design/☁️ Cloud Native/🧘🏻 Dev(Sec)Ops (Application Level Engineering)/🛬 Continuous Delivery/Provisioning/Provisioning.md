## Intro
Provisioning encompasses tools that are used toÂ _create and harden_Â the foundation on which cloud native apps are built. You'll find tools to automatically configure, create, and manage the infrastructure, as well as for scanning, signing, and storing container images. The layer also extends to security with tools that enable policy setting and enforcement, embedded authentication and authorization, and the handling of secrets distribution. That's a mouthful, so let's discuss each category at a time.
