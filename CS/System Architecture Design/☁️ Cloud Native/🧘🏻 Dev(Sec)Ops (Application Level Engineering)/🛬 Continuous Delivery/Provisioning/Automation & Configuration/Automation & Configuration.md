## Intro
Automation and configuration tools speed up the creation and configuration of compute resources (virtual machines, networks, firewall rules, load balancers, etc.). Tools in this category either handle different parts of the provisioning process or try to control everything end-to-end. Most provide the ability to integrate with other projects and products in the space.
