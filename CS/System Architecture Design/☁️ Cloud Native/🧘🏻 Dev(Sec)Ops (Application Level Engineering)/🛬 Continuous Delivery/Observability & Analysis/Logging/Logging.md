## Intro
Applications emit a steady stream of log messages describing what they are doing at any given time. These log messages capture various events happening in the system such as failed or successful actions, audit information, or health events. Logging tools collect, store, and analyze these messages to track error reports and related data. Along with metrics and tracing, logging is one of the pillars of observability.
