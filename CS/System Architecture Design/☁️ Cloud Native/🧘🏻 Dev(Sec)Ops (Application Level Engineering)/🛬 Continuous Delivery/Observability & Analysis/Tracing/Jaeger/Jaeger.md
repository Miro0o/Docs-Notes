Jaeger is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF) as the 7th top-level project (graduated in October 2019). If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who's involved and how Jaeger plays a role, read the CNCF [Jaeger incubation announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/09/13/cncf-hosts-jaeger/) and [Jaeger graduation announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2019/10/31/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-jaeger-graduation/).



## Intro
Jaeger, inspired by [Dapper](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html) and [OpenZipkin](https://zipkin.io/), is a distributed tracing platform created by [Uber Technologies](https://uber.github.io/) and donated to [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/). It can be used for monitoring microservices-based distributed systems:
- Distributed context propagation
- Distributed transaction monitoring
- Root cause analysis
- Service dependency analysis
- Performance / latency optimization
