## Intro
Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) tools enable fast and efficient development with embedded quality assurance. CI automates code changes by immediately building and testing the code, ensuring it produces a deployable artifact. CD goes one step further and pushes the artifact through the deployment phases.

Mature CI/CD systems watch source code for changes, automatically build and test the code, then begin moving it from development to production where it has to pass a variety of tests or validation to determine if the process should continue or fail. Tools in this category enable such an approach.
