## ðŸ‘‰ Error saving credentials: error storing credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop": executable file not found in $PATH
#docker 

### Problem

After a DockerForMac update i've realised, that that the `~/.docker/config.json` file is not refering to osxkeychain anymore. Its uses `docker-credential-desktop`.


### Solusion
Edit the file "**~/.docker/config.json**" and delete the following JSON key/value:
`"credsStore" : "desktop",`

## ðŸ‘‰ Docker pull "unexpected EOF"
#docker 

This was mainly because of weak network ( as I was using mobile hotspot )
configured theÂ **docker daemon**Â to reduce theÂ **tcp packets**
```shell
$ dockerd --max-concurrent-downloads <int>  
```
hereÂ **\<int\>**Â suggests the number of docker pull layers you want to download concurrently.  

**default is 3**

in mycase i had set to 2
```shell
dockerd --max-concurrent-downloads 2 &>/dev/null  
```

downside of doing this is sacrificing your precious time :)  
takes time like hell.

## ðŸ‘‰ ERROR: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket

To create the docker group and add your user:

- Create the docker group.
```shell
sudo groupadd docker
```

- Add your user to the docker group.
```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

- You would need to loog out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated or type the following command:
```shell
su -s ${USER}
```

- Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.
```shell
docker run hello-world
```

- This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.
- If you initially ran Docker CLI commands using sudo before adding your user to the docker group, you may see the following error, which indicates that yourÂ `~/.docker/`Â directory was created with incorrect permissions due to the sudo commands.
```shell
WARNING: Error loading config file: /home/user/.docker/config.json -
stat /home/user/.docker/config.json: permission denied
```

- To fix this problem, either remove theÂ `~/.docker/`Â directory (it is recreated automatically, but any custom settings are lost), or change its ownership and permissions using the following commands:

```shell
sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /home/"$USER"/.docker -R
sudo chmod g+rwx "$HOME/.docker" -R
```
