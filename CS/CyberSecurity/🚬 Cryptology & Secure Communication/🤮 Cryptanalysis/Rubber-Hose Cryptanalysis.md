## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis

In cryptography, rubber-hose cryptanalysis is a euphemism for the extraction of cryptographic secrets (e.g. the password to an encrypted file) from a person by **coercion or torture** — such as beating that person with a rubber hose, hence the name — in contrast to a mathematical or technical cryptanalytic attack.
