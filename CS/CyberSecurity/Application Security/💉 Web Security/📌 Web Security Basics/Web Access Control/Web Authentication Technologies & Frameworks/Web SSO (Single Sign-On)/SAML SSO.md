## Intro
SAML Single Sign-On is a mechanism that leverages SAML allowing users to log on to multiple web applications after logging into the identity provider. As the user only has to log in once, SAML SSO provides a faster, seamless user experience.

### ðŸ†š How Does OAuth Compare to SAML?
OAuth and SAML are both protocols we use for allowing access. However, the primary difference between the two is that we use **SAML for authentication and OAuth for authorization**.

If we revisit the airline analogy, the passenger's ID is the SAML assertion, and the ticket the OAuth token. The airline uses the ID to verify the passengerâ€™s identity before allowing them to board the aircraft. However, once the passengers are on the plane, the flight attendants use the ticket to confirm the passengers' status and entitlement. For example, they may have a first-class ticket giving them access to seats and amenities not accessible by passengers in economy.
