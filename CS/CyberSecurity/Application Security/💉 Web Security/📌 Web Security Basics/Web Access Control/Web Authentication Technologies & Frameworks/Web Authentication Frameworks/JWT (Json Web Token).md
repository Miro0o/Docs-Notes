## Intro
> 🔗 https://jwt.io/introduction

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the **HMAC** algorithm) or a public/private key pair using **RSA** or **ECDSA**.

Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on _signed_ tokens. Signed tokens can verify the _integrity_ of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens _hide_ those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.
