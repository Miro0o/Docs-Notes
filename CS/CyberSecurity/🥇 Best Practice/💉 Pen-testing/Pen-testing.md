### Misconceptions of vulnerability scanning (Vscan), penetration testing (Pentest), and red team exercises (RTE)



### Objective-based Penetration Testing
The primary goal of a pentest/RTE is to determine the real risk, differentiating the risk rating from the scanner and giving a business risk value for each asset, along with the brand image of the organization. It's not about whether how much risk they have; rather, it's about how much they are exposed. A threat that has been found does not really constitute a risk and need not be demonstrated
