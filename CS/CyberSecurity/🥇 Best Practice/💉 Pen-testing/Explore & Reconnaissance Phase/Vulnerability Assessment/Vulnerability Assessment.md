## Intro
The goal of passive and active reconnaissance is to identify the exploitable target and vulnerability assessment is to find the security flaws that are most likely to support the tester's or attacker's objective (denial of service, theft, or modification of data). **The vulnerability assessment during the exploit phase of the kill chain focuses on creating the access to achieve the objective** -- mapping of the vulnerabilities to line up the exploits and to maintain persistent access to the target.

Thousands of exploitable vulnerabilities have been identified, and most are associated with at least one proof-of-concept code file or technique to allow the system to be compromised. Nevertheless, the underlying principles that govern success are the same across networks, operating systems, and applications.

- Vulnerability scanning with `Nmap`
- Lua scripting
- Writing your own `Nmap` script using **`Nmap Scripting Engine`** (**NSE**) Selecting and customizing multiple vulnerability scanners
- Installing `Nexpose` and `Nessus Threat modeling` in general


### 🔍 Local and Online Vulnerability Databases

Penetration testers and attackers must find the particular exploits that will compromise known and suspected vulnerabilities. 

1️⃣ The first place to start the search is at vendor sites; most hardware and application vendors release information about vulnerabilities when they release patches and upgrades. 

2️⃣ Other online sites that collect, analyze, and share information about vulnerabilities like ↗ [Vulnerability Database](../../../../☠️%20Kill%20Chain/🏹%20Vulnerability/Vulnerability%20Database/Vulnerability%20Database.md)

#### 👉 `searchsploit` (kali)
🥰 The Exploit database is also copied locally to Kali and it can be found in the `/usr/share/exploitdb` directory.

To search the local copy of `exploitdb`, open a Terminal window and enter `searchsploit` and the desired search term(s) in the command prompt.

> 💡
> The search script scans for each line in the CSV file from left to right, so the order of the search terms is important; a search for *Oracle 10g* will return several exploits, but *10g Oracle* will not return any. Also, the script is weirdly case sensitive; although you are instructed to use lowercase characters in the search term, a search for *vsFTPd* returns no hits, but *vs FTPd* returns more hits with a space between *vs* and *FTP*. More effective searches of the CSV file can be conducted using the *grep* command or a search tool such as *KWrite* *(**apt-get install kwrite**).*



## Vulnerability nomenclature



## Threat modeling
Offensive threat modeling is a formal approach that combines the results of reconnaissance and research to develop an attack strategy. An attacker has to consider the available targets and identify the types of targets, listed as follows:
- **Primary targets**: These are the primary entry point targets to any organization and when compromised, they serve the objective of a penetration test
- **Secondary targets**: These targets may provide information (security controls, password and logging policies, and local and domain administrator names and passwords) to support an attack or allow access to a primary target
- **Tertiary targets**: These targets may be unrelated to the testing or attack objective, but are relatively easy to compromise and may provide information or a distraction from the actual attack
