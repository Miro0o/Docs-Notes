## Intro
**Passive reconnaissance through OSINT** occurs during the first step of the kill chain when conducting a penetration test, or an attack against a network or server target.

Generally, passive reconnaissance is concerned with analyzing information that is openly available, usually from the target itself or public sources online. On accessing this information, the tester or attacker does not interact with the target in an unusual mannerâ€”requests and activities will not be logged, or will not be traced directly to the tester. Therefore, passive reconnaissance is conducted first to minimize the direct contact that may signal an impending attack or to identify the attacker.
