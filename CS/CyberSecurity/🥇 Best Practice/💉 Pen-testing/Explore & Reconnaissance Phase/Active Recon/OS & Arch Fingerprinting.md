## Intro
Determining the operating system of a remote system is conducted using two types of scans: active fingerprinting & passive fingerprinting. 

Active fingerprinting is faster and more accurate than passive fingerprinting.

## Active Fingerprinting
Active fingerprinting: The attacker sends normal and malformed packets to the target and records its response pattern, referred to as the fingerprint. By comparing the fingerprint to a local database, the operating system can be determined.

## Passive Fingerprinting
Passive fingerprinting: The attacker sniffs, or records and analyzes the packet stream to determine the characteristics of the packets
