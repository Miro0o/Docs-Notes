# Active Recon

[TOC]



## Intro
The main goal of the active reconnaissance phase is to collect and weaponize information about the target as much as possible in order to facilitate the exploitation phase of the kill chain methodology.

Although active reconnaissance produces more useful information, interactions with the target system may be logged, triggering alarms by protective devices, such as firewalls, **Intrusion Detection Systems** (**IDS**), and **Intrusion Prevention Systems** (**IPS**). As the usefulness of the data to the attacker increases, so does the risk of detection

To improve the effectiveness of active reconnaissance in providing detailed information, our focus will be on using stealthy, or difficult to detect, techniques.
