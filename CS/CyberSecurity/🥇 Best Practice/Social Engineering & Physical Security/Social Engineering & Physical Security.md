This is an online resource for security professionals, adversarial simulators (pentesters), as well as enthusiasts. However, you may be asking, “What is Social Engineering?” It’s a blend of science, psychology and art. And, while it is amazing and complex, it is also very simple.

We define social engineering as,  “*Any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interest*” (Christopher Hadnagy, *Social Engineering: The Science of Human Hacking*. 2nd ed. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley Publishing, 2018). We define it in very broad and general terms because we feel that social engineering is not always negative. It can also encompass how we communicate with our parents, therapists, children, spouses, and others.
