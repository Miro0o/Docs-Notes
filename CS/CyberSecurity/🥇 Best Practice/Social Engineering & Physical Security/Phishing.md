# Phish

## Intro
There are prerequisites that need to be set up in Gophish before launching the phishing campaign. These can be broadly divided into four important things to do before launching a successful campaign:

- **Templates**: Templates are a very crucial part of phishing; you must be able to create your own templates based on your game plan. The most commonly used templates are Office365, Webmail, and internal Facebook and Gmail login. Some of the templates can be found at https://github.com/Pac ktPublishing/Mastering-Kali-Linux-for-Advanced-Penetration-Testing-Third-Edition/tre e/master/Chapter05
- **Pages**: The effectiveness of the phishing will always relate to how you redirect the victims to a legitimate website using the landing pages.
- **Profiles**: A profile is the place where you will have all the SMTP details and sender details; Gophish allows attackers to have multiple profiles defined, along with custom email headers.
- **Users and groups**: Upload single or bulk targeted victims email IDs with their first and last names. Gophish allows testers to create groups and import them in CSV format.
