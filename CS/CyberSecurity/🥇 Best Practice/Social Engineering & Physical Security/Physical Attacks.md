## Creating a rogue physical device
One interesting variant is the SanDisk U3 USB key, or Smart Drive. The U3 keys were preinstalled with Launchpad software, which automatically allowed the keys to write files or registry information directly to the host computer when inserted, to assist in the rapid launch of approved programs. The u3-pwn tool (Kali Linux | Applications | Social Engineering Tools | u3-pwn) removes the original ISO file from the SanDisk U3 and replaces it with a hostile Metasploit payload, which is then encoded to avoid detection on the target system. Unfortunately, support for these USB devices is reducing, and they remain vulnerable to the same degree of detection as other Metasploit payloads.
