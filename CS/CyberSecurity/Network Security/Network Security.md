### Awesome Web Security
Needless to say, most websites suffer from various types of bugs which may eventually lead to vulnerabilities. Why would this happen so often? There can be many factors involved including misconfiguration, shortage of engineers' security skills, etc. To combat this, here is a curated list of Web Security materials and resources for learning cutting-edge penetration techniques, and I highly encourage you to read the article "[So you want to be a web security researcher?](https://portswigger.net/blog/so-you-want-to-be-a-web-security-researcher)" first.



## Intro
Network Security includes security issues in all OSI 7 layers, in which web security (which lies in the application layer, but web security is a subset of application layer security) is often the most interesting to the public.

> In general, the term  "web" focus more on the application layer, while the term "network" refers to the whole networking system. However, in the security field, they don't seem to have that much distinction. (??? 🙈)


### Web Security
In general, web security refers to **the protective measures and protocols that organizations adopt to protect the organization from cyber criminals and threats that use the web channel**. Web security is critical to business continuity and to protecting data, users, and companies from risk.

**Network security** consists of the 
1. Security Risk
2. Security Services
3. Security Mechanisms (Policies & Processes & Practices)
	1. prevent
	2. detect
	3. monitor 
	4. defend
unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources.
