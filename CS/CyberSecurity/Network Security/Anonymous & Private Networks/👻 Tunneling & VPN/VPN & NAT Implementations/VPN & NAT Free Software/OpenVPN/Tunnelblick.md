## Intro
**Tunnelblick** helps you control [OpenVPN®](https://openvpn.net/community) VPNs on macOS. It is [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) that puts its users first. There are no ads, no affiliate marketers, no tracking — we don't even keep logs of your IP address or other information. We just supply open technology for fast, easy, private, and secure control of VPNs.

Tunnelblick comes as a ready-to-use application with all necessary binaries and drivers (including OpenVPN, easy-rsa, and tun/tap drivers). No additional installation is necessary — just [add your OpenVPN configuration and encryption information](https://tunnelblick.net/cConfigAndEncryptInfo.html).

To use Tunnelblick you need access to a VPN server: your computer is one end of the tunnel and the VPN server is the other end. For more information, see [Getting VPN Service](https://tunnelblick.net/cGettingVPNService.html).
