## Intro
The Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is **a network protocol used to create VPN tunnels between public networks**. PPTP servers are also known as Virtual Private Dialup Network (VPDN) servers. PPTP is preferred over other VPN protocols because it is faster and it has the ability to work on mobile devices.
