The project‚Äôs technical decision making is managed by the [OpenSSL Technical Committee](https://www.openssl.org/community/otc.html) (OTC) and the project governance is managed by the [OpenSSL Management Committee](https://www.openssl.org/community/omc.html) (OMC). The project operates under formal [Bylaws](https://www.openssl.org/policies/omc-bylaws.html).
