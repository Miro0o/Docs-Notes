# SSL & TLS

[TOC]



> 💡 Heads-up
>
> **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) specifications (1994, 1995, 1996) is an already deprecated protocol.**  It was first introduced by [Netscape Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communications) for adding the HTTPS protocol to their [Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) web browser, then deprecated as the release of **Transport Layer Security** (**TLS**) 1.0 in 1999, which was built on SSL. TLS is a proposed [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF) standard and the current version is TLS 1.3, defined in [RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446), August 2018.

> However SSL and TLS are still used together to refer as SSL/TLS Layer.
