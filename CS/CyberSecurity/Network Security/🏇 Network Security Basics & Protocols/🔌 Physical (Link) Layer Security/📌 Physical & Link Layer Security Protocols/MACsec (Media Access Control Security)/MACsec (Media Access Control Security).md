## Intro
Media Access Control Security [(MACsec)](https://www.comcores.com/ethernet-solutions/macsec/)  is a layer2 security protocol standardized by the IEEE that operates on Ethernet frames. It uses AES GCM cryptography with 128-bit key and 256-bit key versions. MACsec is designed to provide authentication, confidentiality and integrity for data transported on point-to-point links in the enterprise Local Area Network (LAN) using the Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) data cryptography algorithm. The MACsec key agreement is a companion protocol that provides multiple authentications between hosts in a network. It creates a connectivity Association and generates session keys. MACsec adds a security tag and an integrity check value to each Ethernet frame, providing integrity to all the frames and optionally, confidentiality to the user data.
