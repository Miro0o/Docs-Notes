**WLAN Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure**Â (**WAPI**) is aÂ [Chinese National Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guobiao "Guobiao")Â forÂ [Wireless LANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN "Wireless LAN")Â (GB 15629.11-2003). Although it was allegedly designed to operate on top ofÂ [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi "Wi-Fi"), compatibility with the security protocol used by theÂ [802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11 "802.11")Â wireless networking standard developed by theÂ [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE "IEEE")Â is in dispute. Due to the limited access of the standard (only eleven Chinese companies had access), it was the focus of aÂ [U.S.â€“China trade dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_relations "Chinaâ€“United States relations"). Following this it was submitted to, and rejected by theÂ [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization"). It was resubmitted to ISO in 2010, but was cancelled as a project on 21 November 2011 after being withdrawn by China
