A¬†[security operations center](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Security-Operations-Center-SOC)¬†(SOC) is another term you'll hear in the context of incident response teams. However, a SOC generally encompasses multiple aspects of security operations, while CSIRTs, CERTs and CIRTs focus specifically on incident response.

A SOC's purview can include the incident response function (either in whole or in part) as well as other tasks. For example, a SOC can:
- encompass monitoring operations and controls (such as an intrusion detection, system/intrusion prevention system, security information event management/security information management);
- oversee evaluation of operational and security telemetry and information gathering; and,
- manage tasks such as identity management and authorization, firewall and filtering ruleset maintenance (both review and change management), forensics and investigation support, or any other aspect of operational security.

A SOC's monitoring efforts is likely to extend beyond incident response. A SOC might harvest and collect metrics to support customer service or service delivery (at a managed security service provider, for example) or it might support management reporting like preparation of metrics and data to support risk assessment or for audit support. While a SOC often comes up in the context of incident response, it almost always has other elements of security within its scope of responsibility. A SOC is likely to have a broader operational purpose and scope than a CSIRT or CIRT. If there is a SOC in a given organization, incident response likely falls within the purview of the SOC as an operational security function. Again, the specifics depend on the organization.
