**Threat hunting is the practice of proactively searching for cyber threats that are lurking undetected in a network.** Cyber threat hunting digs deep to find malicious actors in your environment that have slipped past your initial endpoint security defenses.

After sneaking in, an attacker can stealthily remain in a network for months as they quietly collect data, look for confidential material, or obtain login credentials that will allow them to [move laterally across the environment](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/lateral-movement/).

Once an adversary is successful in evading detection and an attack has penetrated an organization’s defenses, many organizations lack the advanced detection capabilities needed to stop the [advanced persistent threats](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/advanced-persistent-threat-apt/) from remaining in the network. That’s why threat hunting is an essential component of any defense strategy.
