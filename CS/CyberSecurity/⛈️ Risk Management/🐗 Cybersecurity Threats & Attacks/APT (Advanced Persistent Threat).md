## Intro

An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a broad term used to describe an attack campaign in which an intruder, or team of intruders, establishes an illicit, long-term presence on a network in order to mine highly [sensitive data](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/sensitive-data/).

The targets of these assaults, which are very carefully chosen and researched, typically include large enterprises or governmental networks. The consequences of such [intrusions](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/ethical-hacking/) are vast, and include:
- Intellectual property theft (e.g., trade secrets or patents)
- Compromised sensitive information (e.g., employee and user private data)
- The sabotaging of critical organizational infrastructures (e.g., database deletion)
- Total site takeovers

Executing an APT assault requires more resources than a standard [web application attack](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/web-application-and-api-protection-waap/). The perpetrators are usually teams of experienced [cybercriminals](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/cybercrime/) having substantial [financial](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/financial-services-cybersecurity/) backing. Some APT attacks are government-funded and used as cyber warfare weapons.

APT attacks differ from traditional web application threats, in that:
- They’re significantly more complex.
- They’re not hit-and-run attacks -- once a network is infiltrated, the perpetrator remains in order to attain as much information as possible.
- They’re manually executed (not automated) against a specific mark and indiscriminately launched against a large pool of targets.
- They often aim to infiltrate an entire network, as opposed to one specific part.

More common attacks, such as [remote file inclusion (RFI)](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/rfi-remote-file-inclusion/), [SQL injection](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/sql-injection-sqli/) and [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/cross-site-scripting-xss-attacks/), are frequently used by perpetrators to establish a foothold in a targeted network. Next, Trojans and backdoor shells are often used to expand that foothold and create a persistent presence within the targeted perimeter.
