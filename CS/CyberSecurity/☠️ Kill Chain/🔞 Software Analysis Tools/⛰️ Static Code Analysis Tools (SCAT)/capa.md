## Intro
capa detects capabilities in executable files. You run it against a PE, ELF, .NET module, shellcode file, or a sandbox report and it tells you what it thinks the program can do. For example, it might suggest that the file is a backdoor, is capable of installing services, or relies on HTTP to communicate.
