## Intro
axplorer (Android explorer) is a static analysis tool to study Android's application framework's internals. It generates high-precision call-graphs for middleware services that are subsequently analyzed via control-flow slicing. As one of the results, axplorer can generate very accurate Android API to permission mappings.  

Note: As for now we haven't released the source code yet, due to time constraints that prevent us from publishing well written and documented code.
