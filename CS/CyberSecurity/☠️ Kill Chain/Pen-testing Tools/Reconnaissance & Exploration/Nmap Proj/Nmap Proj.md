> For more than a decade, the [Nmap Project](http://nmap.org/) has been cataloguing the network security community's favorite tools. In 2011 this site became much more dynamic, offering ratings, reviews, searching, sorting, and a [new tool suggestion form](http://sectools.org/contrib/). This site allows open source and commercial tools on any platform, except those tools that we maintain (such as the [Nmap Security Scanner](http://nmap.org/), [Ncat network connector](http://nmap.org/ncat/), and [Nping packet manipulator](http://nmap.org/nping/)).

> We're very impressed by the collective smarts of the security community and we highly recommend reading the whole list and investigating any tools you are unfamiliar with. Click any tool name for more details on that particular application, including the chance to read (and write) reviews. Many site elements are explained by tool tips if you hover your mouse over them. Enjoy!

## Nmap Project
![](../../../../../../../Assets/Pics/sitelogo.png)

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is a free and open source utility for network exploration and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts.

> ❤️ All knowledge about the nmap project itself (manuals, references) and about the network scanning (port scan, os discovery, service fingerpring, etc.) can be found at this book 🔗 https://nmap.org/book/toc.html. (though the public online version only covers half of the original contents of the book)
