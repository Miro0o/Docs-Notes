## Intro
The following items are available in the configuration:
- tool: This is the unique identifier of the command-line tool, for example, `nmap`
- label: This is the text that appears on the context menu
- command: Normally this should be in non-interactive mode and the full command that you will run using a tool
- Services: These are the list of services that need to be run during the automatic run; for example, if you configure to run `nmap` and when port 80 is identified automatically run `nikto`
- Protocol: Either `TCP` or `UDP` are the services that the tool should run on
