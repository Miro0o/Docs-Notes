The _solution_ selections which provide detailed instructions on the best way to solve common networking tasks are also exclusive to the printed book.

> For more than a decade, the [Nmap Project](http://nmap.org/) has been cataloguing the network security community's favorite tools. In 2011 this site became much more dynamic, offering ratings, reviews, searching, sorting, and a [new tool suggestion form](http://sectools.org/contrib/). This site allows open source and commercial tools on any platform, except those tools that we maintain (such as the [Nmap Security Scanner](http://nmap.org/), [Ncat network connector](http://nmap.org/ncat/), and [Nping packet manipulator](http://nmap.org/nping/)).
> 
> We're very impressed by the collective smarts of the security community and we highly recommend reading the whole list and investigating any tools you are unfamiliar with. Click any tool name for more details on that particular application, including the chance to read (and write) reviews. Many site elements are explained by tool tips if you hover your mouse over them. Enjoy!

The [Nmap Project](https://nmap.org/) is pleased to release our new and improved [Icons of the Web](https://nmap.org/favicon/) project! We scanned the Internet's top million web sites and created an interactive 5-gigapixel collage of the results.
