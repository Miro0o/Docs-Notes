## Intro
ZDNS is a utility for performing fast DNS lookups, such as completing an A lookup for all names in a zone file, or collecting CAA records for a large number of websites. ZDNS contains its own recursive resolver and supports A, AAAA, ANY, AXFR, CAA, CNAME, DMARC, MX, NS, PTR, TXT, SOA, and SPF records.
