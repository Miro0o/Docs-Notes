Deep packet inspection (DPI) is an advanced method of examining and managing network traffic. It is a form ofÂ [packet](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/packet)Â filtering that locates, identifies, classifies and reroutes or blocks packets with specificÂ [data](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data)Â orÂ [code](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/code)Â [payloads](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/payload)Â that conventional packet filtering, which examines only packetÂ [headers](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/header), cannot detect.

Usually performed as part of aÂ [firewall](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/firewall)Â defense, deep packet inspection functions at theÂ [application layer](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/Application-layer)Â of the Open Systems Interconnection ([OSI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/OSI)) reference model.
