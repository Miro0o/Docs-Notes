## Intro
Faraday introduces a new concept – **IPE (Integrated Penetration-Test Environment)** which is a multiuser Penetration testing IDE. Faraday is designed for distributing, indexing, and analyzing the data generated during a security audit. It was made to let you take advantage of the available tools in the community in a truly multiuser way.

### Open Source Vulnerability Manager
Security has two difficult tasks: designing smart ways of getting new information, and keeping track of findings to improve remediation efforts. With Faraday, you may focus on discovering vulnerabilities while we help you with the rest. Just use it in your terminal and get your work organized on the run. Faraday was made to let you take advantage of the available tools in the community in a truly multiuser way.

Faraday aggregates and normalizes the data you load, allowing exploring it into different visualizations that are useful to managers and analysts alike.

### Getting-started
Learn about Faraday holistic approach and rethink vulnerability management.
- [Centralize your vulnerability data](https://faradaysec.com/centralize-vulnerability-data/)
- [Automate the scanners you need](https://faradaysec.com/automate-scanners/)


**Integrating faraday in your CI/CD**
1. Setup Bandit and OWASP ZAP in your pipeline

**Faraday Agents**
[Faraday Agents Dispatcher](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_agent_dispatcher) is a tool that gives [Faraday](https://www.faradaysec.com/) the ability to run scanners or tools remotely from the platform and get the results.


**Plugins**
Connect you favorite tools through our [plugins](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_plugins). Right now there are more than [80+ supported tools](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Plugin-List).



## Faraday Cli
🏠 Check our [faraday-cli](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday-cli) repo
🚧 Check out the documentation [here](https://docs.faraday-cli.faradaysec.com/).

Faraday-cli is our command line client, providing easy access to the console tools, work in faraday directly from the terminal!

This is a great way to [automate scans](https://docs.faraday-cli.faradaysec.com/), integrate it to [CI/CD pipeline](https://docs.faraday-cli.faradaysec.com/) or just get [metrics](https://docs.faraday-cli.faradaysec.com/) from a workspace
```shell
$ pip3 install faraday-cli
```
