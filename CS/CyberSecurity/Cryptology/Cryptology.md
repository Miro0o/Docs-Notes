## Cryptology Intro
### ⭐ Cryptology's main purpose
Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Authentication and Non-repudiation are core principles of modern-day Cryptology.

1. **Confidentiality** refers to certain rules and guidelines usually executed under confidentiality agreements which ensure that the information is restricted to certain people or places.
2. **Data integrity** refers to maintaining and making sure that the data stays accurate and consistent over its entire life cycle.
3. **Authentication** is the process of making sure that the piece of data being claimed by the user belongs to it.
4. **Non-repudiation** refers to ability to make sure that a person or a party associated with a contract or a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature over their document or the sending of a message.

#### Types of Cryptosystem
##### Key Specific 根据密码算法所用的密钥数量

对称密码体制(Symmetric cipher，也称为单钥密码体制、秘密密钥密码体制、 对称密钥密码体制或常规密码体制)

非对称密码体制(Asymmetric cipher，也称为双钥密码体制、公 开密钥密码体制、非对称密钥密码体制)

##### Encryption Specific 根据对明文信息的处理方式

分组密码(Block cipher)

序列密码(Stream cipher，也称为流密码)

##### Reversable Specific 根据是否能进行可逆的加密变换

单向函数密码体制

双向变换密码体制
