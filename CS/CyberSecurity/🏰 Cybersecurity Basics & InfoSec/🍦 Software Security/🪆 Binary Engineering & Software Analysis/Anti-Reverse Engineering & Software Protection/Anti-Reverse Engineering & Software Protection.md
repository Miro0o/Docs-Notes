Software protection techniques aim to make reverse engineering (and therefore, decompilation) more difficult by adding complexity to the analysis of the executable code. Here are some advanced code protection techniques commonly used to hinder reverse engineering efforts.
1. **Code obfuscation**
2. **control flow obfuscation**
3. **junk code injection**
4. **code virtualization**
5. **binary packing**
6. **combination of above all**
