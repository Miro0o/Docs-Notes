[🤔 What is decompilation? | JEB Documentation]: https://www.pnfsoftware.com/decompilation

Software decompilation is the process of reverse engineering a compiled software program to recover its source code or a representation close to the original source code. In other words, it involves translating the machine code or bytecode of a compiled program back into a higher-level programming language like C or Java.
