## Intro
### Static Vulnerability Discovery
> Y. Shoshitaishvili et al., "SOK: (State of) The Art of War: Offensive Techniques in Binary Analysis," 2016 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), San Jose, CA, USA, 2016, pp. 138-157, doi: 10.1109/SP.2016.17. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7546500?denied=

Static techniques reason about a program without executing it. Usually, a program is interpreted over an _abstract domain_. Memory locations containing bits of ones and zeroes contain other abstract entities (at the familiar end, this might simply be integers, but, as we explain below, these can include more abstract constructs). Additionally, program constructs such as the layout of memory, or even the execution path taken, may be abstracted as well.

Here, we split static analyses into two paradigms: those that model program properties as graphs (i.e., a _control-flow graph_) and those that model the data itself.

Static vulnerability identification techniques have two main drawbacks, relating to the trade-offs discussed in Section II-A. First, the results are not _replayable_: detection by static analysis must be verified by hand, as information on _how_ to trigger the detected vulnerability is not recovered. Second, these analyses tend to operate on simpler data domains, reducing their _semantic insight_. In short, they over-approximate: while they can often authoritatively reason about the _absence_ of certain program properties (such as vulnerabilities), they suffer from a high rate of false positives when making statements regarding the _presence_ of vulnerabilities.

### Dynamic Vulnerability Discovery
> Y. Shoshitaishvili et al., "SOK: (State of) The Art of War: Offensive Techniques in Binary Analysis," 2016 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), San Jose, CA, USA, 2016, pp. 138-157, doi: 10.1109/SP.2016.17. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7546500?denied=

Dynamic approaches are analyses that examine a program's execution, in an actual or emulated environment, as it acts given a specific input. In this section, we will focus specifically on dynamic techniques that are used for identifying vulnerabilities, rather than the general binary analysis techniques on which they are based.

Dynamic techniques are split into two main categories: concrete and symbolic execution. These techniques produce inputs that are highly _replayable_, but vary in terms of _semantic insight_.

- A. Dynamic Concrete Execution
	- fuzzing
- B. Dynamic Symbolic Execution
	- symbolic-assisted fuzzing
	- under-constrained symbolic execution

[👍 Hunting for Malicious Packages on PyPI]: https://jordan-wright.com/blog/post/2020-11-12-hunting-for-malicious-packages-on-pypi/
About a year ago, the Python Software Foundation [opened a Request for Information (RFI)](https://discuss.python.org/t/what-methods-should-we-implement-to-detect-malicious-content/2240) to discuss how we could detect malicious packages being uploaded to PyPI. Whether it’s [taking over abandoned packages](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm), [typosquatting on popular libraries](https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/issues/984), or [hijacking packages using credential stuffing](https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Gathering-weak-npm-credentials.md), it’s clear this is a real issue affecting nearly every package manager. 

The truth is that package managers like PyPI are critical infrastructure that almost every company relies on. I could write for days on this topic, but I’ll just let this xkcd suffice for now.
