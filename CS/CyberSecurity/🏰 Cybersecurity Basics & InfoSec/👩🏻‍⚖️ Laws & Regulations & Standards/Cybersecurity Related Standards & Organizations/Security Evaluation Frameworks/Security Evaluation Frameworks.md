[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
TCSEC, ITSEC and Common Criteria are the three security evaluation frameworks (That one is required to study for  CISSP) that define multiple security requirements that a computing device should comply with, and depending upon the number of requirements complied to, a rating is assigned to them. TCSEC was replaced by the ITSEC which was later replaced by the global security evaluation framework - Common Criteria.
