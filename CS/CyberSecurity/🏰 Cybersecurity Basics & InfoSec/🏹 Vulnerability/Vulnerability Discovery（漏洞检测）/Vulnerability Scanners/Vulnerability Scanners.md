# Vulnerability Scanners

## nmap & NSE

`nmap -- script-updatedb`


### lua
Lua is a lightweight embeddable scripting language, which is built on top of the C programming language, was created in Brazil in 1993 and is still actively developed. It is a powerful and fast programming language mostly used in gaming applications and image processing. The complete source code, manual, plus binaries for some platforms do not go beyond 1.44 MB (which is less than a floppy disk). 

Some of the security tools that are developed in Lua are **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, and **Snort 3.0**.

One of the reasons why Lua was chosen to be the scripting language in information security is due to its **compactness**, no buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities, and because it can be interpreted.



## Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS)



## Web-application vulnerability scanner

Kali provides access to several different vulnerability scanners, including the following:

- Scanners that extend the functionality of traditional vulnerability scanners to include websites and associated services (for example, the Metasploit framework and Websploit)
- Scanners that extend the functionality of non-traditional applications, such as web browsers, to support web service vulnerability scanning (**OWASP Mantra**)
- Scanners that are specifically developed to support reconnaissance and exploit detection in websites and web services (**Arachnid**, **Nikto**, **Skipfish**, **Vega**, **w3af**, and so on)


### 👉 Nikto


### 👉 Vega


### 👉 Web Application Attack and Audit Framework (w3af)



## Mobile-application vulnerability scanner

### 👉 Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)
**Mobile Security Framework** (**MobSF**) is an open source, automated penetration testing framework for all the mobile platforms, including Android, iOS, and Windows. The entire framework is written in the Django Python framework.



## Commercial vulnerability scanners
Most attackers utilize open source tools to launch attacks; however, commercial vulnerability scanners come with their own advantages and disadvantages in speeding up the penetration testing process.
