## Intro
### Google Hacking Database (GHDB)
The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting, and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases, this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.


### Google Hacking
> ↗ 
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking
> **Google hacking**, also named **Google dorking**, is a hacker technique that uses Google Search and other Google applications to find security holes in the configuration and computer code that websites are using.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “**Googledork**” to refer to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user. Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to show examples of vulnerable web sites.


### Exploit Database
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need actionable data right away.
#### Exploit Database & GHDB
After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as an extension of the [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/), producing different, yet equally valuable results.
