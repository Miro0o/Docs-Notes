In the fields of physical security and information security, **access control** (**AC**) is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource, while access management describes the process. The act of *accessing* may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called *authorization*.

> Locks and login credentials are two analogous mechanisms of access control.

In the field of access control, there are three major aspects:
- Physical Security
- Computer Security
- Telecommunication Security
