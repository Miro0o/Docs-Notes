As of 2014, access-control models tend to fall into one of two classes: those based on [**capabilities**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) and those based on **[access control lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_lists) (ACLs).**

- In a **capability-based model**, holding an unforgeable reference or *capability* to an object provides access to the object (roughly analogous to how possession of one's house key grants one access to one's house); access is conveyed to another party by transmitting such a capability over a secure channel.

- In an **ACL-based model**, a subject's access to an object depends on whether its identity appears on a list associated with the object (roughly analogous to how a bouncer at a private party would check an ID to see if a name appears on the guest list); access is conveyed by editing the list. (Different ACL systems have a variety of different conventions regarding who or what is responsible for editing the list and how it is edited.)
