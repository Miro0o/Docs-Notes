## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Further_reading

**Information security**, sometimes shortened to **InfoSec**, is the practice of protecting [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) by mitigating information risks.

It is part of [information risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management_information_systems). 

It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access to [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data), or the unlawful use, [disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach), disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information. It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents. Protected information may take any form, e.g. electronic or physical, tangible (e.g. [paperwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document)) or intangible (e.g. [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge)). 

Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the [confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality), [integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity), and [availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability) of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy) implementation, all without hampering organization [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity). This is largely achieved through a structured [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management) process that involves: 

- identifying information and related [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_(computer_security)), plus potential [threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_(computer)), [vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)), and impacts;
- evaluating the risks;
- deciding how to address or treat the risks i.e. to avoid, mitigate, share or accept them;
- where risk mitigation is required, selecting or designing appropriate security controls and implementing them;
- monitoring the activities, making adjustments as necessary to address any issues, changes and improvement opportunities.

To standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate to offer guidance, policies, and industry standards on [password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password), [antivirus software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software), [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)), [encryption software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software), [legal liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability), [security awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_awareness) and training, and so forth. This [standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization) may be further driven by a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect how data is accessed, processed, stored, transferred and destroyed. However, the implementation of any standards and guidance within an entity may have limited effect if a culture of [continual improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process) isn't adopted.


### Why InfoSec & CyberSec?
最开始只有信息安全。
安全圈里的大佬们，一直觉得信息安全很重要，要从“计算机科学与技术”一级学科中独立出来，自成一级学科。怎奈，大佬们上书了数年，都以失败告终。

终于有一天，中央提出了“没有网络安全，就没有国家安全”。安全圈里的大佬们觉得机会来了。于是不申请“信息安全”一级学科，改为申请“网络空间安全”一级学科。

过审了。

“网络空间安全”就成了一级学科。招生指标更多了。

### Difference Between InfoSec & CyberSec?



## 🛡️ InfoSec Principles | Goals
### CIA Triad
![|400](../../../Assets/Pics/1920px-CIAJMK1209-en.svg.png)


<small>the CIA triad</small>

> The triad seems to have first been mentioned in a [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST "NIST") publication in 1977

#### 🎯 Confidentiality
In information security, confidentiality "is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes."

#### 🎯 Integrity
In IT security, [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity) means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as [referential integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity) in [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Databases), although it can be viewed as a special case of consistency as understood in the classic [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) model of [transaction processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_processing)

More broadly, integrity is an information security principle that involves human/social, process, and commercial integrity, as well as data integrity. As such it touches on aspects such as credibility, consistency, truthfulness, completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and assurance.

#### 🎯 Availability
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be [available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability) when it is needed.

[High availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability) systems aim to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades.


### Other Security Models & Attributes
Debate continues about whether or not this CIA triad is sufficient to address rapidly changing technology and business requirements, with recommendations to consider expanding on the intersections between availability and confidentiality, as well as the relationship between **security** and **privacy**. 

- In 1992 and revised in 2002, the [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD "OECD")'s _Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks proposed the nine generally accepted principles: [awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security_awareness "Information security awareness"), responsibility, response, ethics, democracy, risk assessment, security design and implementation, security management, and reassessment. Building upon those, in 2004 the [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST "NIST")'s _Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security proposed 33 principles. From each of these derived guidelines and practices.

- In 1998, [Donn Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donn_Parker "Donn Parker") proposed an alternative model for the classic CIA triad that he called the [six atomic elements of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkerian_Hexad "Parkerian Hexad"). The elements are [confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality "Confidentiality"), [possession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership "Ownership"), [integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity "Integrity"), [authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication"), [availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability "Availability"), and [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility "Utility"). The merits of the [Parkerian Hexad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkerian_Hexad "Parkerian Hexad") are a subject of debate amongst security professionals.

- In 2011, [The Open Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group "The Open Group") published the information security management standard [O-ISM3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Information_Security_Maturity_Model "Open Information Security Maturity Model"). This standard proposed an [operational definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition "Operational definition") of the key concepts of security, with elements called "security objectives", related to [access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control "Access control") (9), [availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability "Availability") (3), [data quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality "Data quality") (1), compliance, and technical (4). In 2009, [DoD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoD "DoD") [Software Protection Initiative](https://spi.dod.mil/) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20160925225224/https://www.spi.dod.mil/) 2016-09-25 at the [Wayback Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine "Wayback Machine") released the [Three Tenets of Cybersecurity](https://spi.dod.mil/threat.htm) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20200510012626/https://spi.dod.mil/threat.htm) 2020-05-10 at the [Wayback Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine "Wayback Machine")which are System Susceptibility, Access to the Flaw, and Capability to Exploit the Flaw. Neither of these models are widely adopted.


#### 🎯 Non-repudiation
In law, [non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation "Non-repudiation") implies one's intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction.

It is important to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, **the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology**. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message, and nobody else could have altered it in transit ([data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity "Data integrity")). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity. As such, the sender may repudiate the message (**because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation**)

#### PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Action)


#### Security Controls
##### Administrative Control
Administrative controls (also called procedural controls) consist of approved written policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. Administrative controls form the framework for running the business and managing people.

e.g. the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard)(PCI DSS) required by [Visa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.) and [MasterCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterCard) is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, [password policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy), hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.

##### Logical Control
Logical controls (also called technical controls) use software and data to monitor and control access to information and [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) systems. Passwords, network, and host-based firewalls, network [intrusion detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection) systems, [access control lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list), and data encryption are examples of logical controls.

> ⚠ An important logical control that is frequently overlooked is **the principle of least privilege,** which requires that an individual, program or system process not be granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task.

- A blatant example of the failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege is logging into Windows as a user Administrator to read email and surf the web

##### Physical Control
Physical controls monitor and control the environment of the workplace and computing facilities. They also monitor and control access to and from such facilities. 

> ⚠ An important physical control that is frequently overlooked is the separation of duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself.

- For example, an employee who submits a request for reimbursement should not also be able to authorize payment or print the check.


#### Security Classification
An important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information. Not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection. This requires information to be assigned a [security classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information).

1. The first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior management as the owner of the particular information to be classified. 
2. Next, develop a classification policy. The policy should describe the different classification labels, define the criteria for information to be assigned a particular label, and list the required [security controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_controls) for each classification.


#### Access Control
Access control is generally considered in three steps: identification, [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication), and [authorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization).
