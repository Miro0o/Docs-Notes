# Web of Trust Scheme

## Intro
Concept used in [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy "Pretty Good Privacy"), [GnuPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard "GNU Privacy Guard"), and other [OpenPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenPGP "OpenPGP")-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner. 

❗Its **decentralized** [trust model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_metric#Formal_metrics "Trust metric") is an alternative to the **centralized** trust model of a public key infrastructure, which relies exclusively on a certificate authority (or a hierarchy of such). As with computer networks, there are many independent webs of trust, and any user (through their [public key certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate "Public key certificate")) can be a part of, and a link between, multiple webs.

The web of trust concept was first put forth by PGP creator [Phil Zimmermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann "Phil Zimmermann") in 1992 in the manual for PGP version 2.0:

> As time goes on, you will accumulate keys from other people that you may want to designate as trusted introducers. Everyone else will each choose their own trusted introducers. And everyone will gradually accumulate and distribute with their key a collection of certifying signatures from other people, with the expectation that anyone receiving it will trust at least one or two of the signatures. This will cause the emergence of a decentralized fault-tolerant web of confidence for all public keys.

Note the use of the word emergence in this context. The web of trust makes use of the concept of emergence.
