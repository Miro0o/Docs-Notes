# Database Systems Security

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
**Database Secrity**: The mechanisms that protect the database against intentional or accidental threats.

Security considerations apply to not just the data held in a database: breaches of security may affect other parts of the system, which may in turn affect the database. Consequently, database security encompasses hardware, software, people, and data. 

To effectively implement security requires appropriate controls, which are defined in specific mission objectives for the system.

We consider database security in relation to the following situations:
• theft and fraud;  
• loss of confidentiality (secrecy); • loss of privacy;  
• loss of integrity;  
• loss of availability.


### Threats

**Threats**: Any situation or event, whether intentional or accidental, that may adversely affect a system and consequently the organization.

A threat may be caused by a situation or event involving a person, action, or circum- stance that is likely to bring harm to an organization. The harm may be tangible, such as loss of hardware, software, or data, or intangible, such as loss of credibility or client confidence. The problem facing any organization is to identify all possible threats. Therefore, as a minimum, an organization should invest time and effort in identifying the most serious threats.
