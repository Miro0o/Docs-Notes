## Why InfoSec & CyberSec?

最开始只有信息安全。

安全圈里的大佬们，一直觉得信息安全很重要，要从“计算机科学与技术”一级学科中独立出来，自成一级学科。怎奈，大佬们上书了数年，都以失败告终。

终于有一天，中央提出了“没有网络安全，就没有国家安全”。安全圈里的大佬们觉得机会来了。于是不申请“信息安全”一级学科，改为申请“网络空间安全”一级学科。

过审了。

“网络空间安全”就成了一级学科。招生指标更多了。

## InfoSec Intro

> :link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Further_reading

**Information security**, sometimes shortened to **InfoSec**, is the practice of protecting [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) by mitigating information risks.

 It is part of [information risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management_information_systems). 

It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access to [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data), or the unlawful use, [disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach), disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information. It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents. Protected information may take any form, e.g. electronic or physical, tangible (e.g. [paperwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document)) or intangible (e.g. [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge)). 

Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the [confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality), [integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity), and [availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability) of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy) implementation, all without hampering organization [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity). This is largely achieved through a structured [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management) process that involves: 

- identifying information and related [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_(computer_security)), plus potential [threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_(computer)), [vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)), and impacts;
- evaluating the risks;
- deciding how to address or treat the risks i.e. to avoid, mitigate, share or accept them;
- where risk mitigation is required, selecting or designing appropriate security controls and implementing them;
- monitoring the activities, making adjustments as necessary to address any issues, changes and improvement opportunities.

To standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate to offer guidance, policies, and industry standards on [password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password), [antivirus software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software), [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)), [encryption software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software), [legal liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability), [security awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_awareness) and training, and so forth. This [standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization) may be further driven by a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect how data is accessed, processed, stored, transferred and destroyed. However, the implementation of any standards and guidance within an entity may have limited effect if a culture of [continual improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process) isn't adopted.



## Principles

<small>the CIA triad</small>



### Confidentiality

In information security, confidentiality "is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes."



### Integrity

In IT security, [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity) means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as [referential integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity) in [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Databases), although it can be viewed as a special case of consistency as understood in the classic [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) model of [transaction processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_processing)

More broadly, integrity is an information security principle that involves human/social, process, and commercial integrity, as well as data integrity. As such it touches on aspects such as credibility, consistency, truthfulness, completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and assurance.



### Availability

For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be [available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability) when it is needed.

[High availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability) systems aim to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades.

### Security Controls



#### Administrative control

Administrative controls (also called procedural controls) consist of approved written policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. Administrative controls form the framework for running the business and managing people.

e.g. the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard)[[144\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#cite_note-:0-144) (PCI DSS) required by [Visa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.) and [MasterCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterCard) is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, [password policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy), hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.

#### Logical control

Logical controls (also called technical controls) use software and data to monitor and control access to information and [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) systems. Passwords, network and host-based firewalls, network [intrusion detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection) systems, [access control lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list), and data encryption are examples of logical controls.

:warning: An important logical control that is frequently overlooked is **the principle of least privilege,** which requires that an individual, program or system process not be granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task.

- A blatant example of the failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege is logging into Windows as user Administrator to read email and surf the web

#### Physical control

Physical controls monitor and control the environment of the work place and computing facilities. They also monitor and control access to and from such facilities. 

:warning: An important physical control that is frequently overlooked is separation of duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself.

- For example, an employee who submits a request for reimbursement should not also be able to authorize payment or print the check.





### Classification

An important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information.Not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection.[[165\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#cite_note-165) This requires information to be assigned a [security classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information).

1. The first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior management as the owner of the particular information to be classified. 
2. Next, develop a classification policy. The policy should describe the different classification labels, define the criteria for information to be assigned a particular label, and list the required [security controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_controls) for each classification.



### Access Control

Access control is generally considered in three steps: identification, [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication), and [authorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization).

See more on ↗️  [Access Control](Access Control/Access Control.md).



### Cryptography

Information security uses [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) to transform usable information into a form that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption).

See more on ↗️ [Cryptography](Cryptography/Cryptography.md).





### RMIS

> :link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management_information_systems

A **risk management information system** (RMIS) is an information system that assists in consolidating property values, claims, policy, and exposure information and providing the tracking and management reporting capabilities to enable the user to monitor and control the overall cost of [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management).

The management of risk data and information is key to the success of any risk management effort regardless of an organization's size or industry sector. Risk management information systems/services (RMIS) are used to support expert advice and cost-effective information management solutions around key processes such as:

- Risk identification and [assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment)
- [Risk control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_control)
- [Risk financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_financing)
