**Attribute-based access control** (**ABAC**), also known as **policy-based access control** for [IAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management), defines an access control paradigm whereby a subject's authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some cases, environment attributes.







## XACML

**XACML** stands for "**eXtensible Access Control Markup Language**". The standard defines a declarative fine-grained, attribute-based [access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control) policy language, an architecture, and a processing model describing how to evaluate access requests according to the rules defined in policies.
