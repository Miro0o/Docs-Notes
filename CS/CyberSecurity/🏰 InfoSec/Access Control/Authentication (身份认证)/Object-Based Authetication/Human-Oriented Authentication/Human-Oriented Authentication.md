## Intro



## Password Based (基于口令)
Traditional password authentication is static, which is feasible to attack. That's where dynamic password authentication is adopted.

## Biometrics (生物特征提取)
生物信息不直接存储，而是进行生物特征提取。

- Fingerprint recognition
- Iris recognition
- Facial recognition
- Voice Identification
