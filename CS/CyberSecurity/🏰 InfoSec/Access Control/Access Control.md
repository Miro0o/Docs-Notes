In the fields of physical security and information security, **access control** (**AC**) is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource, while access management describes the process. The act of *accessing* may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called *authorization*.

Locks and login credentials are two analogous mechanisms of access control.

In the field of access control, there are three major aspects:
- Physical Security
- Computer Security
- Telecommunication Security

As of 2014, access-control models tend to fall into one of two classes: those based on [**capabilities**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) and those based on **[access control lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_lists) (ACLs).**

- In a **capability-based model**, holding an unforgeable reference or *capability* to an object provides access to the object (roughly analogous to how possession of one's house key grants one access to one's house); access is conveyed to another party by transmitting such a capability over a secure channel
- In an **ACL-based model**, a subject's access to an object depends on whether its identity appears on a list associated with the object (roughly analogous to how a bouncer at a private party would check an ID to see if a name appears on the guest list); access is conveyed by editing the list. (Different ACL systems have a variety of different conventions regarding who or what is responsible for editing the list and how it is edited.)
