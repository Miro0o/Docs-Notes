## Intro
- Address space layout randomization (ASLR): Put each segment of memory in a different, random location each time the program is run
	- Within each segment of memory, relative addresses are the same (e.g. the RIP is always 4 bytes above the SFP)
- ASLR can shuffle all four segments of memory
- ASLR has very low performance overhead
	- Programs are dynamically linked at runtime
	- We already have to do the work of going through the executable and rewriting code to contain known addresses before executing it, so not much extra cost to ASLR
