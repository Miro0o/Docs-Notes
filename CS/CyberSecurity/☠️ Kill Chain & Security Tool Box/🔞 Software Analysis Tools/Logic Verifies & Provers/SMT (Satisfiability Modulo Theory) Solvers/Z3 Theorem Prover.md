[ü§î Understanding SMT solvers: An Introduction to Z3]: https://de-engineer.github.io/SMT-Solvers/
This post was an overview of SMT solvers with the practical example of a CTF challenge and we also touched a bit on their limitations. I‚Äôm not an expert on the topic, I tried to cover all the introductory knowledge that I could put in without increasing the complexity of the blog. There is indeed far more to learn about and you can do so by checking all the links in the resources section.
