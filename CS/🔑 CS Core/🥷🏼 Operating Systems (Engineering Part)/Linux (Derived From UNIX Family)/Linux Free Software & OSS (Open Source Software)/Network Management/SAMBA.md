## Intro
> Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB networking protocol, and was originally developed by Andrew Tridgell. Samba provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Microsoft Windows Server domain, either as a Domain Controller or as a domain member.

**Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix.**

Samba is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) licensed under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/GPL.html), the Samba project is a member of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://www.sfconservancy.org/).

Since [1992](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/10years.html), Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.

Samba is an important component to seamlessly integrate Linux/Unix Servers and Desktops into Active Directory environments. It can function both as a domain controller or as a regular domain member.
