Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux system that was created for penetration testing and is particularly beneficial for security professionals and amateurs. Kali Linux, formerly known as BackTrack Linux, comes with a number of network auditing tools and apps. Kali can be used as a Live DVD or installed as a host operating system (OS) on a computer like any other Linux.However, using Kali as a general-purpose desktop operating system is not recommended.
