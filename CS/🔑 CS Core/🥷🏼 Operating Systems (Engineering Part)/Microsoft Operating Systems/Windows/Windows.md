## Overview
### History
Microsoft initially used the name Windows in 1985, for an operating environment extension to the primitive MS-DOS operating system, which was a successful OS used on early personal computers. 

This Windows/MS-DOS combination was ultimately replaced by a new version of Windows, known as **Windows NT**, first released in 1993, and intended for laptop and desktop systems. 

Although the basic internal architecture has remained roughly the same since Windows NT, the OS has continued to evolve with new functions and features. 
The latest release at the time of this writing is **Windows 10**. Windows 10 incorporates features from the preceding desktop/laptop release, Windows 8.1, as well as from versions of Windows intended for mobile devices for the Internet of Things (IoT). Windows 10 also incorporates software from the Xbox One system. The resulting unified Windows 10 supports desktops, laptops, smart phones, tablets, and Xbox One.
