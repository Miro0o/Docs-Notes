## 🎯 Generic Global Search Services
1. [Google](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#google)

   According to statistics from **[statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)** and **[statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share)**, Google is dominating the market in all countries on any device (desktop, mobile, and tablet).

2. [Microsoft Bing](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#bing)

3. [Yahoo](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#yahoo)
   [**Yahoo**](https://www.yahoo.com/) is one of the most popular email providers and its web search engine holds third place in search with an average of 1% market share.

4. [Baidu](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#baidu)
   Dumbest shit ever. 💩

5. [Yandex](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#yandex)
   Yandex presents itself as a technology company that builds intelligent products and services powered by machine learning.

   According to Wikipedia, Yandex operates the largest search engine in Russia with about 65% market share in that country.

6. [DuckDuckGo](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#duckduckgo)
   According to DuckDuckGo [**traffic stats**,](https://duckduckgo.com/traffic) they are serving on average 90+ million searches per day but still their overall market share is constantly below 0.6%.

   Unlike what most people believe, [**DuckDuckGo**](https://duckduckgo.com/) does not have a search index of its own (like Google and Bing) but they generate its search results using a variety of **[sources](https://help.duckduckgo.com/results/sources/)**.

   In other words, they don’t have their own data but they depend on other sources (like Yelp, Bing, Yahoo, and StackOverflow) to provide answers to users’ questions

7. [Ask.com](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#ask)
   Formerly known as Ask Jeeves, [**Ask.com**](https://www.ask.com/) receives approximately 0.42% of the search share. ASK is based on a question/answer format where most questions are answered by other users or are in the form of polls.

   It also has the general search functionality but the results returned lack quality compared to Google or even Bing and Yahoo.

8. [Ecosia](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#ecosia)
   [**Ecosia**](https://www.ecosia.org/) is a Berlin-based social business founded by Christian Kroll in 2009. The main reason ecosia was created was to help in financing planting trees and restoration projects. It is thus known as the “tree planting search engine”.

   How does ecosia work? Ecosia is a Bing partner, meaning that its search results are powered by Bing. Ecosia makes money to support the planning of trees by displaying ads in their search results. Every time an ad is clicked, ecosia gets a small share. It is estimated that it takes approx 45 searches to finance the planting of one tree.

9. [Aol.com](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#aol)
   The old-time famous [**AOL**](https://www.aol.com/) is still in the top 10 search engines with a market share that is close to 0.05%.

   The AOL network includes many popular websites like engadget.com, techchrunch.com, and huffingtonpost.com. On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by Verizon Communications.

10. [Internet Archive](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#archive)
    [**archive.org**](https://archive.org/) is the internet archive search engine. You can use it to find out how a web site looked since 1996. It is a very useful tool if you want to trace the history of a domain and examine how it has changed over the years.
