The **Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.**, abbreviated **WMF**, is an American [501(c)(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3) "501(c)(3)") nonprofit organization headquartered in San Francisco, California, and registered there as a charitable foundation. It is the host of Wikipedia, the seventh [most visited website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites "List of most-visited websites") in the world. In addition, the foundation hosts 14 other related content projects. It supports the development of [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki "MediaWiki"), the wiki software that underpins them all.

The Wikimedia Foundation was established in 2003 in St. Petersburg, Florida by [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales "Jimmy Wales"), as a nonprofit way to fund [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia "Wikipedia"), [Wiktionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary "Wiktionary"), and other [crowdsourced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced "Crowdsourced") wiki projects. (Until then, they had been hosted by [Bomis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomis "Bomis"), Wales's for-profit company.) The Foundation finances itself mainly through millions of small donations from Wikipedia readers, collected through email campaigns and annual fundraising banners placed on Wikipedia and its sister projects. These are complemented by grants from philanthropic organizations and tech companies, and starting in 2022, by services income from [Wikimedia Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Enterprise "Wikimedia Enterprise").

The Foundation has grown rapidly throughout its existence. As of December 31, 2023, it has employed over 700 staff and contractors, with annual revenues of $180.2 million, annual expenses of $169 million, net assets of $255 million and a growing endowment, which surpassed $100 million in June 2021.

## 🌸 MediaWiki Software

**MediaWiki** is free and open-source wiki software originally developed by _Magnus Manske_ for use on Wikipedia on January 25, 2002, and further improved by _Lee Daniel Crocker_, after which it has been coordinated by the **Wikimedia Foundation**. It powers several wiki hosting websites across the Internet, as well as most websites hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation including **Wikipedia**, **Wiktionary**, **Wikimedia Commons**, **Wikiquote**, **Meta-Wiki** and **Wikidata**, which define a large part of the set requirements for the software. 

MediaWiki is written in the PHP programming language and stores all text content into a database. 
- The software is optimized to efficiently handle large projects, which can have terabytes of content and hundreds of thousands of views per second. Because Wikipedia is one of the world's largest and most visited websites, achieving scalability through multiple layers of caching and database replication has been a major concern for developers. 
- Another major aspect of MediaWiki is its internationalization; its interface is available in more than 400 languages. The software has more than 1,000 configuration settings and more than 1,800 extensions available for enabling various features to be added or changed.

Besides its usage on Wikimedia sites, MediaWiki has been used as a knowledge management and content management system on websites such as **Fandom**, **wikiHow** and major internal installations like **Intellipedia** and **Diplopedia**.
