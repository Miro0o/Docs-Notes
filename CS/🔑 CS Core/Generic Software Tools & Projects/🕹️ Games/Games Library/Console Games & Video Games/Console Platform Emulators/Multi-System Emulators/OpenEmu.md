OpenEmu is a *free* (you can donate if you like their software) and open source graphical front end for many software emulators (which in turn are also open source). OpenEmu makes it exceedingly easy to get you up and running your favorite older generation titles from a multitude of systems such as Atari, Nintendo, Sega and even arcade systems.

An "experimental" release containing a strictly unsupported core plugin for Arcade systems is also available. Both releases can be downloaded from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/releases).

See the [User guide](https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu/wiki/User-guide) for usage documentation.

### Getting OpenEmu
OpenEmu comes in two flavors. Press Pack and an OpenEmu Experimental Press Pack. The only difference as far as I can tell is that the Press Pack is lacking support for the M.A.M.E., which is arcade machine emulation software.

#### What is M.A.M.E.
For simplicity's sake, I'll define M.A.M.E. as an archive of the vintage software that runs arcade systems from yesteryear. The developers try their best to recreate the software systems that ran/run on arcade based computers and do so strictly via CPU emulation for that purpose. The developers avoid using GPU acceleration for the emulation because the actual running of the software is simply an aside to the purpose of their mission. As a result, if you want to run some older arcade games, aside from having an authentic arcade CPU board, your best option would be the M.A.M.E. project.
