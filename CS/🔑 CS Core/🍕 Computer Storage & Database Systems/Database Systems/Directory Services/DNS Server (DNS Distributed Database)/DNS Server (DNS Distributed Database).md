## DNS Servers' Architecture Design
### Why Decentralized DNS Servers Architectures?
Problems that arise when we try to centralize DNS.
1. Single point of failure
2. Increase in traffic volume
3. Distant centralized database
4. Maintenance

As centralized DNS does not scale because of the reasons mentioned above, a need arose to implement DNS in a distributed manner . The DNS is a distributed system, implemented in a hierarchy of many name servers. The decentralized administration is achieved through delegation.
