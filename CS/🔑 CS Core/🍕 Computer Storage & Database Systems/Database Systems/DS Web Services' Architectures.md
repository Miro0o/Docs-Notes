## DS Architectures in Web
### Mainframe Architecture
![](../../../../../Assets/Pics/Pasted%20image%2020230306154507.png)

| Advantages of Mainframe Architecture | Disadvantages of Mainframe Architecture |
| - | - |
| Large number of concurrent users | Does not take advantage of local computer processing power |
| Able to handle very large volume of transactions | Does not take advantage of local computer processing power |
| Suitable for slow network environments | Does not take advantage of local computer processing power |
| Central location of both application | Hardware is relatively expensive |
| Character-based interface | DBMS makes maintenance relatively simple |


### Desktop Architecture
![|500](../../../../../Assets/Pics/Pasted%20image%2020230306155045.png)

| Advantages of Mainframe Architecture | Disadvantages of Mainframe Architecture |
| - | - |
| Inexpensive to acquire | Only available to a single user at a time |
| Easy to configure | Only available at a single computer|
| Requires few resources to operate | May impose limits on how data can be stored |


### File Server Architecture
![](../../../../../Assets/Pics/Pasted%20image%2020230306155115.png)

| Advantages of Mainframe Architecture | Disadvantages of Mainframe Architecture |
| - | - |
| Inexpensive to acquire | Only viable for a limited number of users, perhaps 10 or fewer |
| Easy to configure | Query performance declines quickly as the amount of data increases |
| Low-cost option for multi-user concurrency | Multiple installation of both application software and DBMS can lead to version control issues for both |


### Client/Server Architecture (Traditional Two-Tier C/S)

![](../../../../../Assets/Pics/Screenshot%202023-03-06%20at%208.09.02%20PM.png)

| Advantages of Mainframe Architecture | Disadvantages of Mainframe Architecture |
| - | - |
| Makes good use of processing power of multiple computers | Application software is distributed, possibly leading to version control issues |
| Handles large amounts of both data and transactions | DBMS software is relatively expensive compared to the file-server approach |
| Can support thousands of concurrent users |  |



### Web Architecture (Three-Tier C/S, MVC)

| Advantages of Mainframe Architecture                                          | Disadvantages of Mainframe Architecture                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All advantages of the client/server architecture                              | Adds another layer of complexity (web server)                       |
| Increased ease of application version control                                 | Various software apps must keep synchronized with database software |
| Very good at handling intermittent use from large numbers of users (millions) | Upgrades in browsers may require changes to application             |
#### Application Server
#TODO 

> 一个应用服务器必须处理以下若千复杂的问题:
> 
> - 并发
> - 网络连接管理
> - 提供对所有数据库服务器的访问
> - 数据库连接池
> - 支持遗留数据库
> - 支持集群
> - 负载平衡
> - 失效备援
