## Intro
[Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/), is also a free and open-source, horizontally scalable distributed in-memory key-value store, cache, and multi-model database system that provides powerful processing APIs for computing distributed data. It is also an in-memory data grid that can be used either in memory or with Ignite native persistence. It runs on UNIX-like systems such as **Linux** and also **Windows**.

It features multi-tier storage, complete SQL support, and **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions (supported only at key-value API level) across multiple cluster nodes, co-located processing, and machine learning. It supports automatic integration with any third-party databases, including any **RDBMS** (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and so on) or NoSQL stores.

It is important to note that although **Ignite** works as an SQL data store, it is not fully an SQL database. It distinctly handles constraints and indexes compared to traditional databases; it supports primary and secondary indexes, but only the primary indexes are used to enforce uniqueness. Besides, it has no support for foreign key constraints.

Ignite also supports security by allowing you to enable authentication on the server and providing user credentials to clients. There is also support for SSL socket communication to provide a secure connection among all Ignite nodes.

**Ignite** has many use cases which include caching systems, system workload acceleration, real-time data processing, and analytics. It can also be used as a graph-centric platform.
