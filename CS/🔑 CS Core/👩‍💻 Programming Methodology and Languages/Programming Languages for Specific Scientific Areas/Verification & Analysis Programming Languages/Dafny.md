Dafny has support for common programming concepts such as 
- mathematical and bounded integers and reals, bit-vectors, classes, iterators, arrays, tuples, generic types, refinement and inheritance,
- [inductive datatypes](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-inductive-datatypes) that can have methods and are suitable for pattern matching,
- [lazily unbounded datatypes](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-co-inductive-datatypes),
- [subset types](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-subset-types), such as for bounded integers,
- [lambda expressions](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-lambda-expressions) and functional programming idioms,
- and [immutable and mutable data structures](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-collection-types).

Dafny also offers an extensive toolbox for mathematical proofs about software, including
- [bounded and unbounded quantifiers](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-quantifier-domains),
- [calculational proofs](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-calc-statement) and the ability to use and prove lemmas,
- [pre- and post-conditions, termination conditions, loop invariants, and read/write specifications](https://dafny.org/latest/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-specification-clauses).
