> **The SysML.org web provides information about the [SysML Partners](https://sysml.org/sysml-partners/) and their [SysML Open Source Specification Project](https://sysml.org/sysml-partners/)**, which created the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) dialect (profile) of the [Unified Modeling Language v. 2 (UML 2)](https://umlforum.com/) for systems engineering applications in 2003. Subsequently, the Object Management Group (OMG) adopted a version of SysML as [OMG SysML](http://www.omgsysml.org/) in 2006, and the _Software Development Times_ awarded the SysML Partners with its ["SD Times 100" award for industry leadership in the “Modeling” category in 2007](http://sdtimes.com/sdtimes-100/2007/best-in-show/modeling-2007/).

## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Modeling_Language


The **Systems Modeling Language**(**SysML**) is a general-purpose modeling language for [systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering "Systems engineering") applications. It supports the specification, analysis, design, verification, and validation of a broad range of systems and [systems-of-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_systems "System of systems").

SysML was originally developed by an open-source specification project, and includes an open-source license for distribution and use. SysML is defined as an extension of a subset of the [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language "Unified Modeling Language") (UML) using [UML's profile mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_(UML) "Profile (UML)"). The language's extensions were designed to support systems engineering activities.


### Contrast with UML 🆚
SysML offers several systems engineering-specific improvements over UML, which has been developed as a software modeling language. These improvements include the following:
- **SysML's diagrams express system engineering concepts better** due to the removal of UML's software-centric restrictions and adds two new diagram types, **requirement** and **parametric diagrams**. The former can be used for [requirements engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering "Requirements engineering"); the latter can be used for [performance analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming) "Profiling (computer programming)") and [quantitative analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"). Consequent to these enhancements, SysML is able to model a wide range of systems, which may include hardware, software, information, processes, personnel, and facilities.
- **SysML is a comparatively small language** that is easier to learn and apply. Since SysML removes many of UML's software-centric constructs, the overall language is smaller both in diagram types and total constructs.
- **SysML allocation tables support common kinds of allocations**. Whereas UML provides only limited support for tabular notations, SysML furnishes flexible allocation tables that support requirements allocation, functional allocation, and structural allocation. This capability facilitates automated [verification and validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation "Verification and validation") (V&V) and gap analysis.
- **SysML model management constructs support models, views, and viewpoints**. These constructs extend UML's capabilities and are architecturally aligned with [IEEE-Std-1471-2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-Std-1471-2000 "IEEE-Std-1471-2000") (IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software Intensive Systems).
