## Intro
Tcl is a very simple programming language. If you have programmed before, you can learn enough to write interesting Tcl programs within a few hours. This page provides a quick overview of the main features of Tcl. After reading this you'll probably be able to start writing simple Tcl scripts on your own; however, we recommend that you consult one of the many available Tcl books for more complete information.
