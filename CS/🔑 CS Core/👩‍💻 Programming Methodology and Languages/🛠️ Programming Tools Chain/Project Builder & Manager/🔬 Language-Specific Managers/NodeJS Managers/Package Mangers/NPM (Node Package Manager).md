# NPM (Node Package Manager)

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
`npm` is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently.

It is extremely configurable to support a variety of use cases. Most commonly, you use it to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.

### Help & Support
`npm` is relatively simple to use (at least for me) and also is well-documented. 
So there is no need for a specific note tracking problems to it.

These commands/res suffice:
`npm help <command>`
`npm --help`
`man npm`

:)
