## Ruby Version /Env Managers
> Quote from RubyMine -- JetBrain 

The most popular way to install Ruby on Linux or macOS is using a version manager, for example, RVM or rbenv. Version managers allow you to install several Ruby versions on your machine and quickly switch between them. RubyMine automatically detects interpreters installed on a local machine and maintained by the following version managers:

- [RVM](https://rvm.io/)
- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) with the [rbenv-gemsets](https://github.com/jf/rbenv-gemset) plugin for gemsets
- [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby)
- [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) with the [asdf-ruby](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby) plugin

You can switch between Ruby interpreters (and gemsets for RVM and rbenv) on the [Ruby SDK & Gems](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/configuring-language-interpreter.html#select_ruby_interpreter) page for existing projects, and choose the desired interpreter when [creating a new project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/create-and-run-your-first-project.html#create_rails_app).
