## Intro
OpenGR is a set C++ libraries for 3D Global Registration, standalone applications and plugins released under the terms of the _APACHE V2 licence_, which makes it free for commercial and research use.

It provides state of the art global registration techniques for 3d pointclouds. Still under active development, the library is currently improved by adding wrappers to existing software, and by stabilizing the API.

In a nutshell, it provides:
- two core packages: algorithms and accelerators,
- a convenience packages: utils,
- several demonstrators:
    - a command line application,
    - wrappers to use the algorithms with the Point Cloud Library and CGAL (coming soon)
    - a meshlab plugin
- a test suite
