## Intro
JikesTM is a compiler that translates JavaTM source files as defined in [The Java Language Specification](http://www.java.sun.com/docs/books/jls) into the bytecoded instruction set and binary format defined in [The Java Virtual Machine Specification](http://www.java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec).

Jikes is an open-source Java compiler written in C++. ==It is no longer being updated.== The original version was developed by David L. "Dave" Shields and Philippe Charles at IBM but was quickly transformed into an open-source project contributed to by an active community of developers
