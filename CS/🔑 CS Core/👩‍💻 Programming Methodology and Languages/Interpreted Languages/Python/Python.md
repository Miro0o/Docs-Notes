- [Python 3 Module of the Week | pymotw.com](https://pymotw.com/3/)
> PyMOTW-3 is a series of articles written by [Doug Hellmann](http://doughellmann.com/) to demonstrate how to use the modules of the [Python](http://www.python.org/) 3 standard library. It is based on the original [PyMOTW](http://pymotw.com/2/) series, which covered Python 2.7. See [About Python Module of the Week](https://pymotw.com/3/about.html) for details including the version of Python and tools used.

### 🔔 Python Code Style & PEP8
🔕 https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code

This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution. Please see the companion informational PEP describing [style guidelines for the C code in the C implementation of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0007/ "PEP 7 – Style Guide for C Code").

This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in the language itself.

Many projects have their own coding style guidelines. In the event of any conflicts, such project-specific guides take precedence for that project.
