**Pascal**Â is anÂ [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming "Imperative programming")Â andÂ [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming")Â [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"), designed byÂ [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth "Niklaus Wirth")Â as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices usingÂ [structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming "Structured programming")Â andÂ [data structuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure"). It is named after French mathematician, philosopher and physicistÂ [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal "Blaise Pascal").

Pascal was developed on the pattern of theÂ [ALGOL 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60 "ALGOL 60")language. Wirth was involved in the process to improve the language as part of theÂ [ALGOL X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_X "ALGOL X")Â efforts and proposed a version namedÂ [ALGOL W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_W "ALGOL W"). This was not accepted, and the ALGOL X process bogged down. In 1968, Wirth decided to abandon the ALGOL X process and further improve ALGOL W, releasing this as Pascal in 1970.

On top of ALGOL'sÂ [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science) "Variable (computer science)")Â andÂ [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_type) "Array (data type)"), Pascal enables defining complex datatypes and building dynamic and recursive data structures such asÂ [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type) "List (abstract data type)"),Â [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure) "Tree (data structure)")Â andÂ [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type) "Graph (abstract data type)"). Pascal hasÂ [strong typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing "Strong and weak typing")Â on all objects, which means that one type of data cannot be converted to or interpreted as another without explicit conversions. Unlike C (and most languages in theÂ [C-family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-family "C-family")), Pascal allowsÂ [nested procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_procedure "Nested procedure")Â definitions to any level of depth, and also allows most kinds of definitions and declarations insideÂ [subroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutines "Subroutines")Â (procedures and functions). A program is thus syntactically similar to a single procedure or function. This is similar to the block structure of ALGOL 60, but restricted from arbitrary block statements to just procedures and functions.

Pascal became very successful in the 1970s, notably on the burgeoningÂ [minicomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer "Minicomputer")Â market.Â [Compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler")Â were also available for manyÂ [microcomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer "Microcomputer")Â as the field emerged in the late 1970s. It was widely used as a teaching language inÂ [university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University "University")-level programming courses in the 1980s, and also used in production settings for writing commercial software during the same period. It was displaced by theÂ [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)")Â during the late 1980s and early 1990s asÂ [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX "UNIX")-based systems became popular, and especially with the release ofÂ [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++").

A derivative namedÂ [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal "Object Pascal")Â designed forÂ [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming")Â was developed in 1985. This was used byÂ [Apple Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.")Â (for the Lisa and Macintosh machines) andÂ [Borland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland "Borland")Â in the late 1980s and later developed intoÂ [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software) "Delphi (software)")Â on theÂ [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows")Â platform. Extensions to the Pascal concepts led to the languagesÂ [Modula-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2 "Modula-2")Â andÂ [Oberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(programming_language) "Oberon (programming language)"), both developed by Wirth.
