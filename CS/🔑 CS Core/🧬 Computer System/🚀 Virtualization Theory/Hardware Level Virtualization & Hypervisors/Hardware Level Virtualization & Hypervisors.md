This Manual provides the basic concepts and procedures for VMS system
management; it is especially inteded for managers of small clusters and
systems.

## Intro
> There are differences between "hardware level virtualization" (which virtualize machine from hardware level) and "hardware-assisted virtualization" (which implementation virtualization services on hardware, usually the CPU)



## Hypervisor Architectures
> 🔗 According to [Formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/361011.361073) (1974), Hypervisors (VMMs) are divided into two categories: **native** and **hosted**.
