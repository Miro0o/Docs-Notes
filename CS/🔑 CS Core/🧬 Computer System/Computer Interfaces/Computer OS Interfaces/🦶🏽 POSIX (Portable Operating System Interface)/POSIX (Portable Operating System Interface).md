## Intro
> Not to be confused with [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix"), [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like"), or [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux"). Differ from Windows NT.

> ⚠️  to understand what is Posix you need to first understand **[what is API](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/ask/26856)**, and the system-level API & user-lever API.

The **Portable Operating System Interface** (**POSIX**) is a family of standards specified by the [IEEE Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society "IEEE Computer Society") for **maintaining compatibility between operating systems**. POSIX defines both the system and user level application programming interfaces (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability) with variants of Unix and other operating systems. 

POSIX is also a trademark of the IEEE. POSIX is intended to be used by both application and system developers.


### Principles of POSIX
Some of the guiding principles behind POSIX design are:
- POSIX is created to make application portability easier. So it’s not for UNIX systems only. Non-UNIX systems can be POSIX-compliant too.
- The standard doesn’t dictate the development of the application or the operating system. It only defines the contract between them.
- POSIX-compliant application source code should be able to run across many systems because the standard is defined at the source code level. However, the standard doesn’t guarantee any object or binary code level portability. So the binary executable may not run even on similar machines with identical hardware and operating systems. Only source code portability is addressed in the standard.
- POSIX is written in terms of Standard C. But developers can implement it in any language they like.
- The standard only deals with aspects of the operating system that interacts with applications.
- The standard is kept succinct in terms of length and broad in terms of scope to cover a large array of systems.
- POSIX was designed to simplify portability. So it will save time and money in the long run. However, if your applications are not POSIX-compliant, it might require significant time and resource investment at the beginning.


### Austin Group
There are misconceptions in the development community that POSIX standard is old and irrelevant. It is not true. POSIX is a living document that is being regularly updated by the [Austin Group](https://www.opengroup.org/austin/). Anyone can join the group and participate in improving the standard. The standard is used actively in today’s servers, workstations, routers, mobile devices, embedded systems and more. It is used for UNIX and Linux machines.

However, developers should be aware that POSIX standard has problems. You can report any bug you discover to the Austin Group and it will be looked into for the next revision.


### POSIX OS
#### POSIX-certified (2022)
Current versions of the following operating systems have been certified to conform to one or more of the various POSIX standards. This means that they passed the automated conformance tests and their certification has not expired and the operating system has not been discontinued.

- [Cygwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin) provides a largely POSIX-compliant development and run-time environment for Microsoft Windows.
- [MinGW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW), a fork of Cygwin, provides a less POSIX-compliant development environment and supports compatible [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))-programmed applications via [Msvcrt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Msvcrt), Microsoft's old Visual C runtime library.
- [Microsoft POSIX subsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_POSIX_subsystem), an optional Windows subsystem included in Windows NT-based operating systems up to Windows 2000. POSIX-1 as it stood in 1990 revision, without threads or sockets.
- [Interix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interix), originally OpenNT by Softway Systems, Inc., is an upgrade and replacement for [Microsoft POSIX subsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_POSIX_subsystem) that was purchased by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) in 1999. It was initially marketed as a stand-alone add-on product and then later included it as a component in [Windows Services for UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Services_for_UNIX) (SFU) and finally incorporated it as a component in [Windows Server 2003 R2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2003_R2) and later Windows OS releases under the name "Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications" (SUA); later made deprecated in 2012 (Windows 8) and dropped in 2013 (2012 R2, 8.1). It enables full POSIX compliance for certain Microsoft Windows products.

### History of Unix, Posix, and the Standard Unix Specification
> Quote from CSAPP

The 1960s was an era of huge, complex operating systems, such as IBM’s OS/360 and Honeywell’s Multics systems. While OS/360 was one of the most successful software projects in history, Multics dragged on for years and never achieved wide-scale use. Bell Laboratories was an original partner in the Multics project but dropped out in 1969 because of concern over the complexity of the project and the lack of progress. In reaction to their unpleasant Multics experience, a group of Bell Labs researchers—Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna—began work in 1969 on a simpler operating system for a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 computer, written entirely in machine language. Many of the ideas in the new system, such as the hierarchical file system and the notion of a shell as a user-level process, were borrowed from Multics but implemented in a smaller, simpler package. In 1970, Brian Kernighan dubbed the new system “Unix” as a pun on the complexity of “Multics.” The kernel was rewritten in C in 1973, and Unix was announced to the outside world in 1974.

Because Bell Labs made the source code available to schools with generous terms, Unix developed a large following at universities. The most influential work was done at the University of California at Berkeley in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Berkeley researchers adding virtual memory and the Internet protocols in a series of releases called Unix 4.xBSD (Berkeley Software Distribution). Concurrently, Bell Labs was releasing their own versions, which became known as System V Unix. Versions from other vendors, such as the Sun Microsystems Solaris system, were derived from these original BSD and System V versions.

Trouble arose in the mid 1980s as Unix vendors tried to differentiate themselves by adding new and often incompatible features. To combat this trend, IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electron- ics Engineers) sponsored an effort to standardize Unix, later dubbed “Posix” by Richard Stallman. The result was a family of standards, known as the Posix standards, that cover such issues as the C language interface for Unix system calls, shell programs and utilities, threads, and network program- ming. More recently, a separate standardization effort, known as the “Standard Unix Specification,” has joined forces with Posix to create a single, unified standard for Unix systems. As a result of these standardization efforts, the differences between Unix versions have largely disappeared.
