## Parallel Data Transmission
> In parallel data transmission, the interface requires one conductor for each bit
> Parallel cables are fatter than serial ones
> 

### Attenuation



## Serial Data Transmission
> Compared with parallel data interfaces, serial communication interfaces are: 
> 1. require fewer conductors
> 2. less susceptible to attenuation
> 3. generally sent faster and more reliably over long distance communication than parallel data.
