## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array

**Video Graphics Array** (**VGA**) is a [video display controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_display_controller "Video display controller") and accompanying de facto graphics standard, first introduced with the [IBM PS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2 "IBM PS/2") line of computers in 1987, which became ubiquitous in the [IBM PC compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible "IBM PC compatible") industry within three years. The term can now refer to the [computer display standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_display_standard "Computer display standard"), the 15-pin [D-subminiature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature "D-subminiature") [VGA connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector "VGA connector"), or the 640 × 480 [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution "Graphics display resolution") characteristic of the VGA hardware.

VGA was the last IBM graphics standard to which the majority of IBM PC compatible computer manufacturers conformed, making it the [lowest common denominator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator#Colloquial_usage "Lowest common denominator") that virtually all post-1990 PC graphics hardware can be expected to implement.

IBM intended to supersede VGA with the [Extended Graphics Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Graphics_Array "Extended Graphics Array") (XGA) standard, but failed. Instead, VGA was adapted into many extended forms by third parties, collectively known as [Super VGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_VGA "Super VGA"), then gave way to custom [graphics processing units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit "Graphics processing unit") which, in addition to their proprietary interfaces and capabilities, continue to implement common VGA graphics modes and interfaces to the present day.

The VGA analog interface standard has been extended to support resolutions of up to 2048 × 1536 and even higher in special applications
