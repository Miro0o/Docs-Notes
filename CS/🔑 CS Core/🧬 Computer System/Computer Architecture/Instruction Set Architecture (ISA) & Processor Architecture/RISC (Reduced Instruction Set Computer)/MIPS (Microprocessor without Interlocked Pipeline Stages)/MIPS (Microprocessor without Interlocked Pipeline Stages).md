## Intro
MIPS stands for **Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages**.

The MIPS family of CPUs has been one of the most successful and flexible designs of its class. The MIPS R3000, R4000, R5000, R8000, and R10000 are some of the many registered trademarks belonging to MIPS Technologies, Inc.

We first want to expand on the importance of MIPS. It is very lightweight and it handles pipelining very well. This makes MIPS an excellent candidate for use in both firmware and routers, not to mention embedded systems and IoT devices. (Firmware is basically code that is developed and installed to perform some specific set of functions.) In addition, there are a significant number of security-critical devices that run on MIPS, making the ability to reverse engineer various systems a good skill to have.

> MIPS chips are used in embedded systems, in addition to computers (such as Silicon Graphics machines) and various computerized toys (Nintendo and Sony use the MIPS CPU in many of their products). Cisco, a very successful manufacturer of internet routers, uses MIPS CPUs as well.
