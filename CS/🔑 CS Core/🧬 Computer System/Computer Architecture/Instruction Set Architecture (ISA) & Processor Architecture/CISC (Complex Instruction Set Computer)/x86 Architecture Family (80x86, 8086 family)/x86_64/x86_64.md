## Intro



## 🎯 x86_64 Register
> ↗ [ASM /FAQ /👉 How many registers actually are there in a x64 CPU?](../../../../../../👩‍💻%20Programming%20Methodology%20and%20Languages/ASM%20(Assembly%20Languages)/FAQ.md#👉%20How%20many%20registers%20actually%20are%20there%20in%20a%20x64%20CPU?)

x64 extends x86's 8 general-purpose registers to be 64-bit, and adds 8 new 64-bit registers. The 64-bit registers have names beginning with "r". For example, the 64-bit extension of **eax** is called **rax**. The new registers are named **r8** through **r15**.

The lower 32 bits, 16 bits, and 8 bits of each register are directly addressable in operands. This includes registers, like **esi**, whose lower 8 bits weren't previously addressable. The following table specifies the assembly-language names for the lower portions of 64-bit registers.

Operations that output to a 32-bit subregister are automatically zero-extended to the entire 64-bit register. Operations that output to 8-bit or 16-bit subregisters aren't zero-extended (this is compatible x86 behavior).

The high 8 bits of **ax**, **bx**, **cx**, and **dx** are still addressable as **ah**, **bh**, **ch**, **dh** but can't be used with all types of operands.

The instruction pointer **eip** and **flags** register have been extended to 64 bits (**rip** and **rflags**, respectively).

The x64 processor also provides several sets of floating-point registers:
- Eight 80-bit x87 registers.
- Eight 64-bit MMX registers. (These registers overlap with the x87 registers.)
- The original set of eight 128-bit SSE registers is increased to sixteen.



## 🎯 x86_64 Calling Conventions
Unlike the x86, the C/C++ compiler only supports one calling convention on x64. This calling convention takes advantage of the increased number of registers available on x64:
- The first four integer or pointer parameters are passed in the **rcx**, **rdx**, **r8**, and **r9** registers.
- The first four floating-point parameters are passed in the first four SSE registers, **xmm0**-**xmm3**.
- The caller reserves space on the stack for arguments passed in registers. The called function can use this space to spill the contents of registers to the stack.
- Any additional arguments are passed on the stack.
- An integer or pointer return value is returned in the **rax** register, while a floating-point return value is returned in **xmm0**.
- **rax**, **rcx**, **rdx**, **r8**-**r11** are volatile.
- **rbx**, **rbp**, **rdi**, **rsi**, **r12**-**r15** are nonvolatile.

The calling convention for C++ is similar. The **this** pointer is passed as an implicit first parameter. The next three parameters are passed in remaining registers, while the rest are passed on the stack.



## 🎯 x86_64 Addressing Modes
The addressing modes in 64-bit mode are similar but not identical to x86.
- Instructions that refer to 64-bit registers are automatically performed with 64-bit precision. For example, **mov rax, [rbx]** moves 8 bytes beginning at **rbx** into **rax**.
- A special form of the **mov** instruction has been added for 64-bit immediate constants or constant addresses. For all other instructions, immediate constants or constant addresses are still 32 bits.
- x64 provides a new **rip**-relative addressing mode. Instructions that refer to a single constant address are encoded as offsets from **rip**. For example, the **mov rax, [**_addr_**]** instruction moves 8 bytes beginning at _addr_ + **rip** to **rax**.

Instructions, such as **jmp**, **call**, **push**, and **pop**, that implicitly refer to the instruction pointer and the stack pointer treat them as 64 bits registers on x64.
