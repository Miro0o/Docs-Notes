## Intro
> 📎 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XFS

**XFS** is a journaled 64-bit file system created by [SGI](http://www.sgi.com/). Until 1994 it was only available for IRIX. Since the 1st of May 2001 it is officially part of Vanillia [Linux](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Linux)2.4. Internally, XFS is organized in balanced B+Trees and uses Extends to store data. XFS is fully supported by all Ubuntu-Versions (however, there are some issues listed under "Disadvantages").
