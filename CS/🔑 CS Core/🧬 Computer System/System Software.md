## Intro: Software at System Level
The **collection of software at system software level** runs below application programs and just above the instruction set architecture level. These are the software components, the “machines,” with which your application source code interacts. 

Programs at system software level work together to grant access to the hardware resources that carry out the commands contained in application programs. But to look at a computer system as if it were a single thread running from application source code down to the gate level is to limit our understanding of what a computer system is. We would be ignoring the rich set of services provided at each level.

#### Operating System
This part of knowledge is noted at ↗ [Operating System & OS Kernel (Theory Part)](Operating%20System%20&%20OS%20Kernel%20(Theory%20Part)/Operating%20System%20&%20OS%20Kernel%20(Theory%20Part).md).
#### Middleware
Although our model of a computer system places only the operating system in the “system software” level, the study of system software often includes **compilers** and other utilities (**Database**, for example) providing platform level services, as well as a category of complex programs sometimes called **middleware**.

**Generally speaking, middleware is a broad classification for software that provides services above the operating system layer, but below the application program layer.**
##### Compilers
