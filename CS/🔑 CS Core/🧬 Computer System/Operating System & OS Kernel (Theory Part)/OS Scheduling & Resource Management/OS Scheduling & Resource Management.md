## Intro
In a multiprogramming system, multiple processes exist concurrently in main memory. Each process alternates between using a processor and waiting for some event to occur, such as the completion of an I/O operation. The processor or processors are kept busy by executing one process while the others processes wait.

The key to multiprogramming is scheduling. There are 4 types of scheduling summarized below.
