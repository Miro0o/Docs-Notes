# File Systems & Operating Systems

## Intro
Many OS include support for more than one file system. Sometimes the OS and the file system are so tightly interwoven that it is difficult to separate out file system functions.

There needs to be an interface provided by the operating system software between the user and the file system. 
- This interface can be textual (such as provided by a command line interface, such as the [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell"), or [OpenVMS DCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language "DIGITAL Command Language")) 
- or graphical (such as provided by a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface"), such as [file browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_browser "File browser")). If graphical, the metaphor of the [folder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folder_(computing) "Folder (computing)"), containing documents, other files, and nested folders is often used (see also: [directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(file_systems) "Directory (file systems)") and folder).

## 👉 Other File Systems
- The Prospero File System is a file system based on the Virtual System Model. The system was created by Dr. B. Clifford Neuman of the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California.

- [RSRE FLEX file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_machine#RSRE_FLEX_Computer_System "Flex machine") - written in [ALGOL 68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68 "ALGOL 68")

- The file system of the [Michigan Terminal System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System "Michigan Terminal System") (MTS) is interesting because: (i) it provides "line files" where record lengths and line numbers are associated as metadata with each record in the file, lines can be added, replaced, updated with the same or different length records, and deleted anywhere in the file without the need to read and rewrite the entire file; (ii) using program keys files may be shared or permitted to commands and programs in addition to users and groups; and (iii) there is a comprehensive file locking mechanism that protects both the file's data and its metadata
