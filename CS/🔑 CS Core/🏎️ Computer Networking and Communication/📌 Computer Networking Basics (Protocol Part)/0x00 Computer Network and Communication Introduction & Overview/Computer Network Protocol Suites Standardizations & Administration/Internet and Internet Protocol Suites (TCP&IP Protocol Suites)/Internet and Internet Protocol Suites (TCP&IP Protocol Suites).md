## Intro: The Internet
> 💡 [Internet](https://www.henduohao.com/product/1065.html)

The **Internet** (or **internet**) is the **global system of interconnected [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) that uses the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices**. It is a *[network of networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking)* that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and [optical networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_networking) technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) documents and [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) (WWW), [electronic mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email), [telephony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_telephony), and [file sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing).

The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.

- The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the **[Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF)**, a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.

## Intro: TCP/IP Protocol Suites

> 🔗 [Internet protocol suite -- WiKipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite)
> 
> **TL;DR**
> Internet protocol suites cover the network layer and layers above, i.e. link layer and physical layer are excluded in these suites. 
> 
> Internet protocol suites are implemented primarily for the Internet but similar computer networks as well. 

The **Internet protocol suite,** commonly known as **TCP/IP,** is a framework for organizing the set of [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) used in the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) and similar [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) according to functional criteria. The foundational protocols in the suite are the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (TCP), the [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (UDP), and the [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (IP). In the development of this networking model, early versions of it were known as the **Department of Defense** (**DoD**) **model** because the research and development were funded by the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense) through [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA).


### Layering Architecture
The Internet protocol suite provides [end-to-end data communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle) specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, [routed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing), and received. This functionality is organized into four [abstraction layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer), which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking.

### Protocol Stack
An implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a [protocol stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack). From lowest to highest, the layers are 
1. the [link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer), containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); 
2. the [internet layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer), providing [internetworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking) between independent networks; 
3. the [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer), handling host-to-host communication; 
4. and the [application layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer), providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.

The technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF). 

The Internet protocol suite **predates** the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.

1.  [**SSL Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-socket-layer-ssl/) **:** 
    - SSL Protocol stands for Secure Sockets Layer protocol, which is an encryption-based Internet security protocol that protects confidentiality and integrity of data.
    - SSL is used to ensure the privacy and authenticity of data over the internet.
    - SSL is located between the application and transport layers.
    - At first, SSL contained security flaws and was quickly replaced by the first version of TLS that’s why SSL is the predecessor of the modern TLS encryption.
    - TLS/SSL website has “HTTPS” in its URL rather than “HTTP”.
    - SSL is divided into three sub-protocols: the Handshake Protocol, the Record Protocol, and the Alert Protocol.

2.  [**TLS Protocol**](https://write.geeksforgeeks.org/post/3143483) **:**
    - Same as SSL, TLS which stands for Transport Layer Security is widely used for the privacy and security of data over the internet.
    - TLS uses a pseudo-random algorithm to generate the master secret which is a key used for the encryption between the protocol client and protocol server.
    - TLS is basically used for encrypting communication between online servers like a web browser loading a web page in the online server.
    - TLS also has three sub-protocols the same as SSL protocol – Handshake Protocol, Record Protocol, and Alert Protocol.

3.  **SHTTP :** 
    - SHTTP stands for Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is a collection of security measures like Establishing strong passwords, setting up a firewall, thinking of antivirus protection, and so on designed to secure internet communication.
    - SHTTP includes data entry forms that are used to input data, which has previously been collected into a database. As well as internet-based transactions.
    - SHTTP’s services are quite comparable to those of the SSL protocol.
    - Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol works at the application layer (that defines the shared communications protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a network) and is thus closely linked with HTTP.
    - SHTTP can authenticate and encrypt HTTP traffic between the client and the server.
    - SHTTP operates on a message-by-message basis. It can encrypt and sign individual messages.

4.  [**Set Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-electronic-transaction-set-protocol/) **:**
    - Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) is a method that assures the security and integrity of electronic transactions made using credit cards.
    - SET is not a payment system; rather, it is a secure transaction protocol that is used via the internet.
    - The SET protocol provides the following services:
        - It establishes a safe channel of communication between all parties engaged in an e-commerce transaction.
        - It provides confidentiality since the information is only available to the parties engaged in a transaction when and when it is needed.
    - The SET protocol includes the following participants:
        - **Cardholder**
        - **Merchant**
        - **Issuer**
        - **Acquire**
        - **Payment Gateway**
        - **Certification Authority**

5.  [**PEM Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/privacy-enhanced-mail-pem-and-its-working/) **:**
    - PEM Protocol stands for privacy-enhanced mail and is used for email security over the internet.
    - RFC 1421, RFC 1422, RFC 1423, and RFC 1424 are the four particular papers that explain the Privacy Enhanced Mail protocol.
    - It is capable of performing cryptographic operations such as encryption, nonrepudiation, and message integrity.

6.  **PGP Protocol :**
    - PGP Protocol stands for Pretty Good Privacy, and it is simple to use and free, including its source code documentation.
    - It also meets the fundamental criteria of cryptography.
    - When compared to the PEM protocol, the PGP protocol has grown in popularity and use.
    - The PGP protocol includes cryptographic features such as encryption, non-repudiation, and message integrity.
