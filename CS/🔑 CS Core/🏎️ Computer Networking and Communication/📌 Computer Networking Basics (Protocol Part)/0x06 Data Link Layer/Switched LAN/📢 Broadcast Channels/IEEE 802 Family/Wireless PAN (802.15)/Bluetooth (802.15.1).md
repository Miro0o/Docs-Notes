🐒 **Bluetooth** is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances and building [personal area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network) (PANs).

🔉 In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 2.5 [milliwatts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliwatt), giving it a very short range of up to 10 metres (33 ft). It employs [UHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency) [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave) in the [ISM bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band), from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz. 

- It is mainly used as an alternative to wire connections, to 📥 exchange files between nearby portable devices and connect 📲  [cell phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_phone) and 🎧 music players with [wireless headphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_headphone). 

🏢 Bluetooth is managed by the **[Bluetooth Special Interest Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Special_Interest_Group) (SIG)**, which has more than 35,000 member companies in the areas of telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics.

- The [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers) standardized Bluetooth as **IEEE 802.15.1**, but no longer maintains the standard. The Bluetooth SIG oversees development of the specification, manages the qualification program, and protects the trademarks.

 A manufacturer must meet [Bluetooth SIG standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Special_Interest_Group#Qualification) to market it as a Bluetooth device. A network of [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent) apply to the technology, which are licensed to individual qualifying devices.
