## Intro
### Web Advent
Until the early 1990s, the Internet was used primarily by researchers, academics, and university students to log in to remote hosts, to transfer files from local hosts to remote hosts and vice versa, to receive and send news, and to receive and send elec- tronic mail. Although these applications were (and continue to be) extremely useful, the Internet was essentially unknown outside of the academic and research communities. 

Then, in the early 1990s, a major new application arrived on the scene -- the World Wide Web [Berners-Lee 1994]. The Web was the first Internet application that caught the general public’s eye. It dramatically changed how people interact inside and outside their work environments. It elevated the Internet from just one of many data networks to essentially the one and only data network.


### Web Terminology
A **Web page** (also called a **document**) consists of **objects**. An object is simply a file -- such as an HTML file, a JPEG image, a Javascrpt file, a CCS style sheet file, or a video clip—that is addressable by a single URL. 

Most Web pages consist of a **base HTML file** and several **referenced objects**. For example, if a Web page contains HTML text and five JPEG images, then the Web page has six objects: the base HTML file plus the five images. The base HTML file references the other objects in the page with the objects’ **URLs**. 

Each **URL** has two components: the hostname of the server that houses the object and the object’s path name. For example, the URL
<http://www.someSchool.edu/someDepartment/picture.gif>

has `www.someSchool.edu` for a hostname and `/someDepartment/picture.gif` for a path name. Because Web browsers (such as Internet Explorer and Chrome) implement the client side of HTTP, in the context of the Web, we will use the words browser and client interchangeably. 

**Web servers**, which implement the server side of HTTP, house Web objects, each addressable by a URL. Popular Web servers include Apache and Microsoft Internet Information Server.
