## Intro
**Network-attached storage** (**NAS**) is a file-level (as opposed to [block-level storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-level_storage "Block-level storage")) [computer data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage "Computer data storage") server connected to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") providing data access to a [heterogeneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_computing "Heterogeneous computing") group of clients. The term "NAS" can refer to both the technology and systems involved, or a specialized device built for such functionality (as unlike tangentially related technologies such as [local area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network"), a NAS device is often a singular unit).


### OS Platforms & NAS Protocols
NFS is mostly applied on Unix and Unix-like systems;

SMB and [NetWare Core Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetWare_Core_Protocol "NetWare Core Protocol") (NCP) occur more often than NFS on systems running Microsoft Windows;

AFP occurs more often than NFS in Apple Macintosh systems;

QFileSvr.400 occurs more often in IBM i systems.

[Haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku_(operating_system) "Haiku (operating system)") in 2012 added NFSv4 support as part of a Google Summer of Code project.
