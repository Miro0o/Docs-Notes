[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
> Our treatment of MPLS will be necessarily brief, as entire books could be (and have been) written on these networks. We recommend [Davie 2000] for details on MPLS. We’ll focus here primarily on how MPLS servers interconnect to IP devices, although we’ll dive a bit deeper into the underlying technologies as well.
