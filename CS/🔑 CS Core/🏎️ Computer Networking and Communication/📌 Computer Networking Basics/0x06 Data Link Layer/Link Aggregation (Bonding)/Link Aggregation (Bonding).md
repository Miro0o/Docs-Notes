In computer networking, link aggregation is the combining (aggregating) of multiple network connections in parallel by any of several methods. Link aggregation increases total throughput beyond what a single connection could sustain, and provides redundancy where all but one of the physical links may fail without losing connectivity. A **link aggregation group (LAG)** is the combined collection of physical ports.

Other umbrella terms used to describe the concept include **trunking**, **bundling**, **bonding**, **channeling** or **teaming**.

Implementation may follow vendor-independent standards such as Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) for Ethernet, defined in IEEE 802.1AX or the previous IEEE 802.3ad, but also proprietary protocols.
