### Two Types of Link-Layer Channels
In discussing the link layer, we’ll see that there are two fundamentally different types of link-layer channels. 

- The first type are **broadcast channels**, which connect multiple hosts in wireless LANs, in satellite networks, and in hybrid fiber-coaxial cable (HFC) access networks. Since many hosts are connected to the same broadcast communication channel, a so-called **medium access protocol (MAC)** is needed to coordinate frame transmission. In some cases, a central controller may be used to coordinate transmissions; in other cases, the hosts themselves coordinate transmissions. 

- The second type of link-layer channel is the **point-to-point communication link**, such as that often found between two routers connected by a long-distance link, or between a user’s office computer and the nearby Ethernet switch to which it is connected. Coordinating access to a point-to-point link is simpler; the reference material on this book’s Web site has a detailed discussion of the **Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)**, which is used in settings ranging from dial-up service over a telephone line to high-speed point-to-point frame transport over fiber-optic links.

### Implementation of Link Layer 
#### 1️⃣ Hardware Level Implementation
Figure 6.2 shows a typical host architecture. The Ethernet capabilities are either integrated into the motherboard chipset or implemented via a low-cost dedicated Ethernet chip. For the most part, the link layer is implemented on a chip called the **network adapter**, also sometimes known as a **network interface controller (NIC)**. The network adapter implements many link layer services including framing, link access, error detection, and so on. Thus, much of a link-layer controller’s functionality is implemented in hardware.

> For example, Intel’s 700 series adapters [Intel 2020] implements the **Ethernet protocols** we’ll study in Section 6.5; the Atheros AR5006 [Atheros 2020] controller implements the **802.11 WiFi** protocols we’ll study in Chapter 7.

- On the sending side, the controller takes a datagram that has been created and stored in host memory by the higher layers of the protocol stack, encapsulates the datagram in a link-layer frame (filling in the frame’s various fields), and then transmits the frame into the communication link, following the **link-access protocol**. 

- On the receiving side, a controller receives the entire frame, and extracts the network-layer datagram. If the link layer performs error detection, then it is the sending controller that sets the error-detection bits in the frame header and it is the receiving controller that performs error detection.

#### 2️⃣ Software Level Implementation
> Figure 6.2 shows that while most of the link layer is implemented in hardware, part of the link layer is implemented in software that runs on the host’s CPU. 

The software components of the link layer implement higher-level link-layer functionality such as 
1. assembling link-layer addressing information
2. activating the controller hardware. 

On the receiving side, link-layer software responds to **controller interrupts** (for example, due to the receipt of one or more frames), handling error conditions and passing a datagram up to the network layer. 

Thus, the link layer is a combination of hardware and software -- the place in the protocol stack where software meets hardware. [Intel 2020] provides a readable overview (as well as a detailed description) of the XL710 controller from a software-programming point of view.

### 🧐 Link Virtualization: A Network as a Link Layer
Because this chapter concerns link-layer protocols, and given that we’re now nearing the chapter’s end, let’s reflect on how our understanding of the term link has evolved. We began this chapter by viewing the link as a physical wire connecting two communicating hosts. In studying multiple access protocols, we saw that multiple hosts could be connected by a shared wire and that the “wire” connecting the hosts could be radio spectra or other media. This led us to consider the link a bit more abstractly as a **channel**, rather than as a **wire**. In our study of Ethernet LANs (Figure 6.15), we saw that the interconnecting media could actually be a rather complex switched infrastructure. Throughout this evolution, however, the hosts themselves maintained the view that the interconnecting medium was simply a link-layer channel connecting two or more hosts.

> We saw, for example, that an Ethernet host can be blissfully unaware of whether it is connected to other LAN hosts by a single short LAN segment (Figure 6.17) or by a geographically dispersed switched LAN (Figure 6.15) or by a VLAN (Figure 6.26).

In the case of a **dialup modem connection** between two hosts, the link connecting the two hosts is actually the telephone network -- a logically separate, global telecommunications network with its own switches, links, and protocol stacks for data transfer and signaling. From the Internet link-layer point of view, however, the dial-up connection through the telephone network is viewed as a simple “wire.” In this sense, the Internet virtualizes the telephone network, viewing the telephone network as a link-layer technology providing link-layer connectivity between two Internet hosts.

> You may recall from our discussion of overlay networks in Chapter 2 that an overlay network similarly views the Internet as a means for providing connectivity between overlay nodes, seeking to overlay the Internet in the same way that the Internet overlays the telephone network.

> Frame-relay and ATM networks can also be used to interconnect IP devices, though they represent a slightly older (but still deployed) technology and will not be covered here; see the very readable book [Goralski 1999] for details



## Link Layer Network Virtualization
### Drawbacks in Traditional Link Layer Networks
1. L**ack of traffic isolation**. Although the hierarchy localizes group traffic to within a single switch, broadcast traffic (e.g., frames carrying ARP and DHCP messages or frames whose destination has not yet been learned by a self-learning switch) must still traverse the entire institutional network. Limiting the scope of such broadcast traffic would improve LAN performance. Perhaps more importantly, it also may be desirable to limit LAN broadcast traffic for security/privacy reasons. For example, if one group contains the company’s executive management team and another group contains disgruntled employees running Wireshark packet sniffers, the network manager may well prefer that the executives’ traffic never even reaches employee hosts. This type of isolation could be provided by replacing the center switch in Figure 6.15 with a router. We’ll see shortly that this isolation also can be achieved via a switched (layer 2) solution.
2. **Inefficient use of switches**. If instead of three groups, the institution had 10 groups, then 10 first-level switches would be required. If each group were small, say less than 10 people, then a single 96-port switch would likely be large enough to accommodate everyone, but this single switch would not provide traffic isolation.
3. **Managing users**. If an employee moves between groups, the physical cabling must be changed to connect the employee to a different switch in Figure 6.15. Employees belonging to two groups make the problem even harder.
