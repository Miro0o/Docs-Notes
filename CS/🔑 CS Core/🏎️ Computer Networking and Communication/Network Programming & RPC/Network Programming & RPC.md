## Intro
### Network Programming


### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
RPC is an implementation of ↗ [IPC (Inter Process Communication)](../../👷🏾‍♂️%20Computer%20System/Operating%20System%20&%20OS%20Kernel%20(Theory%20Part)/OS%20Processes%20&%20Automata%20Management%20(CPU%20+%20Main%20Memory%20Resource)/IPC%20(Inter%20Process%20Communication)/IPC%20(Inter%20Process%20Communication).md)
