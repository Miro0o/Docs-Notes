**Short Message/Messaging Service**, commonly abbreviated as **SMS**, is a [text messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging) service component of most [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone), [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) and [mobile device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device) systems. It uses standardized [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocols) that let mobile devices exchange short text messages. An intermediary service can facilitate a text-to-voice conversion to be sent to landlines.
#### How does it work actually?
Your handset uses the Short Message Peer to Peer (SMPP) protocol to communicate with Telephone operators gateways. SMPP is used to send and receive messages from and to GSM, UMTS, iDEN, CDMA, and TDMA cell phones. This level-7 TCP/IP protocol allows fast delivery of SMS messages.

Once you type the SMS, it travels via radio waves to the control channel, which is the pathway that allows your cell phone to interact with your phone tower. This enables your cell phone to send and receive SMS messages.
