**VP8** (Video Compression Format or Video Compression Specification) is a specification for encoding and decoding high definition video as either a file or a bitstream for viewing. VP8 is contained in the WebM open source project sponsored by Google along with VP9. Unlike its counterpart H.264 codec, VP8 codec is free. This is due to Google having released all of the VP8 patents it owns under a royalty-free public license. H.264, however, contains patented technology and requires licenses from patent holders and limited royalties for hardware.

VP8 is currently the default video codec used in WebRTC. Around 90% or more of all WebRTC video sessions use VP8.
