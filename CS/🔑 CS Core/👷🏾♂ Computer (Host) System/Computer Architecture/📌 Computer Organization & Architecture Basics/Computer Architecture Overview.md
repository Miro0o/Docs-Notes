**Level 6: The User Level(用户层）**
- ﻿﻿Program execution and user interface level.
- ﻿﻿The level with which we are most familiar.

**Level 5: High-Level Language Level（高级语言层）**
• The level with which we interact when we write programs in languages such as Python, C, Pascal, Lisp, and Java.

**Level 4: Assembly Language Level(汇编语言层）**
• Acts upon assembly language produced from Level 5, as well as instructions programmed directly at this level.

**Level 3: System Software Level(系统软件层）**
- ﻿﻿Controls executing processes on the system.
- ﻿﻿Protects system resources.
- ﻿﻿Assembly language instructions often pass through Level 3 without modification.

**Level 2: Machine Level**
- ﻿﻿Also known as the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Level.
- ﻿﻿Consists of instructions that are particular to the architecture of the machine.
- ﻿﻿Programs written in machine language need no compilers, interpreters, or assemblers（汇编程序）

**Level 1: Control Level（控制层）**
- ﻿﻿A control unit decodes and executes instructions and moves data through the system.
- ﻿﻿Control units can be microprogrammed or hardwired（硬接线的）
- ﻿﻿A microprogram is a program written in a low-level language that is implemented by the hardware.
- ﻿﻿Hardwired control units consist of hardware that directly executes machine instructions.

**Level 0: Digital Logic Level (数字逻辑层)**
- ﻿﻿This level is where we find digital circuits (the chips).
- ﻿﻿Digital circuits consist of gates and wires.
- ﻿﻿These components implement the mathematical logic of all other levels.

### Computer Microarchitecture Models
Control units can be designed in one of two ways: They can be hardwired or they can be microprogrammed. These implement the ISA from design level to real physical machine.

#### 2️⃣ Harvard Based

> 🤨 Many modern general-purpose computers use a modified version of the Harvard architecture in which they have **separate pathways for data and instructions but not separate storage**. (指令和数据存一块，但是用单独的总线分别取)
> 
> 🧐 Pure Harvard architectures are typically used in **microcontrollers** (an entire computer system on a chip), such as those found in embedded systems, as in appliances, toys, and cars. (指令和数据分开存，分开取)

#### 🙈 More Architecture Models!
To list a few:
1. **Neural networks** (using ideas from models of the brain as a computing paradigm) implemented in silicon, cellular automata, cognitive computers (machines that learn by experience rather than through programming, e.g., IBM’s SyNAPSE computer, a machine that models the human brain);
2. **Quantum computation** (a combination of computing and quantum physics)
3. **Dataflow computation**;
4. **Parallel computers**.
