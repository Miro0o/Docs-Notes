## 🐌 Intro
> 🔗 Check out more on [GNU Software Homepage](https://www.gnu.org/software/#navigation)

>  [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/about-gnu.html) is an operating system that is 100% free software. It was launched in 1983 by Richard Stallman (rms) and has been developed by many people working together for the sake of freedom of all software users to control their computing. Technically, GNU is generally like Unix. But unlike Unix, GNU gives its users freedom.

The GNU system contains all of the [official GNU software packages](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#GNUsoftware) (which are listed below) and also includes non-GNU free software, notably TeX and the X Window System. Also, the GNU system is not a single static set of programs; users and distributors may select different packages according to their needs and desires. The result is still a variant of the GNU system.

👀 If you're looking for **a whole system t**o install, see our 🔗 [list of GNU/Linux distributions which are entirely free software](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html).

👀 To look for **individual free software packages**, both GNU and non-GNU, please see the 🔗 [Free Software Directory](http://directory.fsf.org/): a categorized, searchable database of free software.

-  The Directory is actively maintained by the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) and includes links to program home pages where available, as well as entries for [all GNU packages](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/GNU/). 
- Another list of [all GNU packages](https://www.gnu.org/software/#allgnupkgs) is below. [Free software documentation links](https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html) are listed separately.

♻️ Finally, we have [a short list of free software replacements](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Free_software_replacements) for proprietary software running on various proprietary systems.

🎓 We have also published a [list of recommended educational software](https://www.gnu.org/software/free-software-for-education.html).
