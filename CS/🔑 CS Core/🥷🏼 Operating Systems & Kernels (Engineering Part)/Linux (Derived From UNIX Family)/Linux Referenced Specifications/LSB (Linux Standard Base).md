## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base

The **Linux Standard Base (LSB)** was a joint project by several Linux distributions under the organizational structure of the Linux Foundation to standardize the software system structure, including the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. LSB was based on the ↗ [POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)](../../../🧬%20Computer%20System/Computer%20Interfaces%20&%20Hardware%20Drivers/System%20Call%20Interfaces%20(SCI)/POSIX%20(Portable%20Operating%20System%20Interface).md) specification, the ↗ [SUS (Single UNIX Specification)](../../UNIX%20Family/SUS%20(Single%20UNIX%20Specification).md), and several other open standards, but extended them in certain areas.

According to LSB:

> The goal of the LSB is to develop and promote a set of open standards that will increase compatibility among Linux distributions and enable software applications to run on any compliant system even in binary form. In addition, the LSB will help coordinate efforts to recruit software vendors to port and write products for Linux Operating Systems.
