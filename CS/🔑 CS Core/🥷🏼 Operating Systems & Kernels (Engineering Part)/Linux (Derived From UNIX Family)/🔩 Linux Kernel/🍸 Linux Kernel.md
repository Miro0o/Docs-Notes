#### Linux development model
> 📎 https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/lectures/intro.html

The Linux kernel is one the largest open source projects in the world with thousands of developers contributing code and millions of lines of code changed for each release.

It is distributed under the GPLv2 license, which simply put, requires that any modification of the kernel done on software that is shipped to customer should be made available to them (the customers), although in practice most companies make the source code publicly available.

There are many companies (often competing) that contribute code to the Linux kernel as well as people from academia and independent developers.

The current development model is based on doing releases at fixed intervals of time (usually 3 - 4 months). New features are merged into the kernel during a one or two week merge window. After the merge window, a release candidate is done on a weekly basis (rc1, rc2, etc.)
#### Maintainer hierarchy
> 📎 https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/lectures/intro.html

In order to scale the development process, Linux uses a hierarchical maintainership model:

- Linus Torvalds is the maintainer of the Linux kernel and merges pull requests from subsystem maintainers
- Each subsystem has one or more maintainers that accept patches or pull requests from developers or device driver maintainers
- Each maintainer has its own git tree, e.g.:
    - Linux Torvalds: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
    - David Miller (networking): git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/
- Each subsystem may maintain a -next tree where developers can submit patches for the next merge window

Since the merge window is only a maximum of two weeks, most of the maintainers have a -next tree where they accept new features from developers or maintainers downstream while even when the merge window is closed.

Note that bug fixes are accepted even outside merge window in the maintainer's tree from where they are periodically pulled by the upstream maintainer regularly, for every release candidate.

- arch - contains architecture specific code; each architecture is implemented in a specific sub-folder (e.g. arm, arm64, x86)
- block - contains the block subsystem code that deals with reading and writing data from block devices: creating block I/O requests, scheduling them (there are several I/O schedulers available), merging requests, and passing them down through the I/O stack to the block device drivers
- certs - implements support for signature checking using certificates
- crypto - software implementation of various cryptography algorithms as well as a framework that allows offloading such algorithms in hardware
- Documentation - documentation for various subsystems, Linux kernel command line options, description for sysfs files and format, device tree bindings (supported device tree nodes and format)
- drivers - driver for various devices as well as the Linux driver model implementation (an abstraction that describes drivers, devices buses and the way they are connected)
- firmware - binary or hex firmware files that are used by various device drivers

#### \*arch subsystem
> 📎 https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/refs/heads/master/lectures/intro.html

- Architecture specific code
- May be further sub-divided in machine specific code
- Interfacing with the boot loader and architecture specific initialization
- Access to various hardware bits that are architecture or machine specific such as interrupt controller, SMP controllers, BUS controllers, exceptions and interrupt setup, virtual memory handling
- Architecture optimized functions (e.g. memcpy, string operations, etc.)

This part of the Linux kernel contains architecture specific code and may be further sub-divided in machine specific code for certain architectures (e.g. arm).

"Linux was first developed for 32-bit x86-based PCs (386 or higher). These days it also runs on (at least) the Compaq Alpha AXP, Sun SPARC and UltraSPARC, Motorola 68000, PowerPC, PowerPC64, ARM, Hitachi SuperH, IBM S/390, MIPS, HP PA-RISC, Intel IA-64, DEC VAX, AMD x86-64 and CRIS architectures.”

It implements access to various hardware bits that are architecture or machine specific such as interrupt controller, SMP controllers, BUS controllers, exceptions and interrupt setup, virtual memory handling.

It also implements architecture optimized functions (e.g. memcpy, string operations, etc.)

### Linux Kernel Components Overview
![WechatIMG484](../../../../../Assets/Pics/WechatIMG484.jpg)


![](../../../../../../../Assets/Pics/Screenshot%202023-03-30%20at%2012.48.02%20PM.png)

Briefly, the principal kernel components are the following:
- **Signals**: The kernel uses signals to call into a process. For example, signals are used to notify a process of certain faults, such as division by zero. 
- **System calls**: The system call is the means by which a process requests a specific kernel service. There are several hundred system calls, which can be roughly grouped into six categories:
	- file system
	- process
	- scheduling
	- interprocess communication
	- socket (networking)
	- miscellaneous
- **Processes and scheduler**: Creates, manages, and schedules processes.
- **Virtual memory**: Allocates and manages virtual memory for processes.
- **File systems**: Provide a global, hierarchical namespace for files, directories, and other file-related objects and provide file system functions.
- **Network protocols**: Support the Sockets interface to users for the TCP/IP protocol suite.
- **Character device drivers**: Manage devices that require the kernel to send or receive data one byte at a time, such as terminals, modems, and printers.
- **Block device drivers**: Manage devices that read and write data in blocks, such as various forms of secondary memory (magnetic disks, CD-ROMs, etc.).
- **Network device drivers**: Manage network interface cards and communications ports that connect to network devices, such as bridges and routers.
- **Traps and faults**: Handle traps and faults generated by the processor, such as a memory fault.
- **Physical memory**: Manages the pool of page frames in real memory and allocates pages for virtual memory.
- **Interrupts**: Handle interrupts from peripheral devices.

> 🔗 https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/rust/index.html

To start using Rust in the kernel, please read the [Quick Start](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/rust/quick-start.html)guide.

**The Rust support was merged in v6.1 into mainline in order to help in determining whether Rust as a language was suitable for the kernel, i.e. worth the tradeoffs.**

Currently, the Rust support is primarily intended for kernel developers and maintainers interested in the Rust support, so that they can start working on abstractions and drivers, as well as helping the development of infrastructure and tools.

If you are an end user, please note that there are currently no in-tree drivers/modules suitable or intended for production use, and that the Rust support is still in development/experimental, especially for certain kernel configurations.

This documentation does not include rustdoc generated information.
