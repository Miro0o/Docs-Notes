### System Calls and Library Wrapper Functions
> 🔍 `man 2 syscalls`
> 🔍 `man 2 intro`

A system call is an entry point into the Linux kernel. Usually, system calls are not invoked directly: instead, most system calls  have  corresponding  C  library  wrapper functions in `glibc` (or perhaps some other library) which  perform  the  steps  required  (e.g., trapping to kernel mode) in order to invoke the system call. Thus, making a system call looks the same as invoking a normal library function. Often, but not always, the name of the wrapper function is the same as the name of the system call that it invokes.  For example, `glibc` contains a function chdir() which invokes the underlying "chdir" system call.

Often the `glibc` wrapper function is quite thin, doing little work other than:
- copying arguments and the unique system call number to the registers where the kernel expects them;
- trapping to kernel mode, at which point the kernel does the real work of the system call;
- setting errno if the system call returns an error number when the kernel returns the CPU to user mode.

> Note: system calls indicate a failure by returning a negative error number to the caller on architectures without a separate error register/flag, as noted in `syscall(2)`; when this happens, the wrapper function negates the returned error number (to make it positive), copies it to errno, and returns -1 to the caller of the wrapper.
 
However, in a few cases, a wrapper function may do rather more than this, for example, performing some preprocessing of the  arguments  before  trapping to kernel mode, or post-processing of values returned by the system call.  Where this is the case, the manual pages in Section 2 generally try to note the details of both the (usually  GNU)  C  library API interface and the raw system call.  Most commonly, the main DESCRIPTION will focus on the C library interface, and differences for the system call are covered in the NOTES section.

> For example, nowadays there are (for reasons described below) two related system calls, truncate(2) and truncate64(2), and the `glibc` truncate() wrapper function checks which of those system calls are provided by the kernel and determines which should be employed.

### 🤔 `syscall()` -- A Wrapper Function Invoking System Calls
> 🔍 `man syscall`

`syscall()` is a small library function that invokes the system call whose assembly language interface has the specified number with the specified arguments.  Employing `syscall()` is useful, for example, when invoking a  system  call that has no wrapper function in the C library. 

`syscall()` saves  CPU  registers  before  making the system call, restores the registers upon return from the system call, and stores any error returned by the system call in `errno(3)`.

Symbolic constants for system call numbers can be found in the header file `<sys/syscall.h>`.

**TL;DR**
This blog post explains how Linux programs call functions in the Linux kernel. It will outline several different methods of making systems calls, how to handcraft your own assembly to make system calls (examples included), kernel entry points into system calls, kernel exit points from system calls, glibc wrappers, bugs, and much, much more.

Here is a summary of the topics this blog post will cover,
- What is a system call?
- Prerequisite information
    - Hardware and software
    - User programs, the kernel, and CPU privilege levels
    - Interrupts
    - Model Specific Registers (MSRs)
- Calling system calls with assembly is a bad idea - A word of caution about calling system calls with assembly
- **Legacy system calls**

**Executing a program**
- [execve](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_system_calls/execve.htm): executes a program or a script and waits it to finish. It accepts three arguments: the full path to the program (or script, if the first line indicates the interpreter using the [shebang notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))); the list of arguments to the program (the zeroth argument being the program name itself, as called) and a list of environment variables in _key=value_ format.
- [exit](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_system_calls/exit.htm): ends the current process and return the value of the argument status to the parent process. All open file descriptors are closed, any child process is adopted by process 1 (_init_) and the parent process receives a **SIGCHLD** signal.
- [wait/waitpid](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_system_calls/wait.htm): block the current process until the child process finishes. There are different ways to set the arguments, but basically they allow to pick a single child process, a group or all; and select the ways the child process can finish and stop the system call. It can be also used to collect the child process exit status. A child process that has terminated but is still not be "waited" by its parent process is known as [zombie process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process).
- [fork](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_system_calls/fork.htm): create a new process duplicating the current process. The child process has a copy of parent memory, inherits the opened file descriptors and continues executing right after `fork()` call. The function call returns the child process id to the parent process and 0 to the child process (so, the program code can tell if it's now running in the parent or in a child). On Linux, the child memory is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so it doesn't necessarily uses as much memory as its parent.
- [clone](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_system_calls/clone.htm): similar to fork, but can be used to create a thread instead a process. Unlike a child process, a thread shares its parent memory space, file descriptors and table of signal handlers. Unlike `fork()`, it doesn't continue the execution from the same point: instead, a function and its arguments are passed to the system call: while the parent process continues the execution from the same point, the child starts from the specified position. Since the parent process and its threads share the same memory, they can exchange data faster than children processes; however they should be careful to not overwrite the memory space another thread is using.
