### 👉 Miller
🏠 https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

**Miller is a command-line tool for querying, shaping, and reformatting data files in various formats including CSV, TSV, JSON, and JSON Lines.**

**The big picture:** Even well into the 21st century, our world is full of text-formatted data like CSV. Google *CSV memes*, for example. We need tooling to *thrive in this world*, nimbly manipulating data which is in CSVs. And we need tooling to *move beyond CSV*, to be able to pull data out and into other storage and processing systems. Miller is designed for both these goals.


### 👉 VisiData
