The kernel has two different debugger front ends (==`kdb`== and ==`kgdb`==) which interface to the **debug core**. It is possible to use either of the debugger front ends and dynamically transition between them if you configure the kernel properly at compile and runtime.

- **`Kdb`** is simplistic shell-style interface which you can use on a system console with a keyboard or serial console. You can use it to inspect memory, registers, process lists, `dmesg`, and even set breakpoints to stop in a certain location. `Kdb` is not a source level debugger, although you can set breakpoints and execute some basic kernel run control. `Kdb` is mainly aimed at doing some analysis to aid in development or diagnosing kernel problems. You can access some symbols by name in kernel built-ins or in kernel modules if the code was built with `CONFIG_KALLSYMS`.

- **`Kgdb`** is intended to be used as a source level debugger for the Linux kernel. It is used along with gdb to debug a Linux kernel. The expectation is that `gdb` can be used to “break in” to the kernel to inspect memory, variables and look through call stack information similar to the way an application developer would use `gdb` to debug an application. It is possible to place breakpoints in kernel code and perform some limited execution stepping. 
- Two machines are required for using `kgdb`. One of these machines is a development machine and the other is the target machine. The kernel to be debugged runs on the target machine. The development machine runs an instance of gdb against the `vmlinux` file which contains the symbols (not a boot image such as `bzImage`, `zImage`, `uImage`...). In gdb the developer specifies the connection parameters and connects to `kgdb`. The type of connection a developer makes with gdb depends on the availability of `kgdb` I/O modules compiled as built-ins or loadable kernel modules in the test machine’s kernel.
