The **DualSense** is a a game controller developed by [Sony Interactive Entertainment](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Company:Sony_Interactive_Entertainment "Company:Sony Interactive Entertainment") and manufactured by [Sony](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Company:Sony "Company:Sony"), released on November 12, 2020. It was released alongside the [PlayStation 5](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Emulation:PlayStation_5 "Emulation:PlayStation 5").

In addition to features carried over from its predecessor, the [DualShock 4](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Controller:DualShock_4 "Controller:DualShock 4"), the DualSense has introduced two new features, the resistance-based adaptive triggers and the voice-coil-actuator-based haptic feedback. On PC, selected games have native support for either feature or both.

In addition to the standard white color model, the DualSense also comes in midnight black, cosmic red, nova pink, starlight blue, galactic purple, grey camouflage, volcanic red, cobalt blue and sterling silver. It also has limited editions for games like _[God of War Ragnarök](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/God_of_War_Ragnar%C3%B6k "God of War Ragnarök")_, _[Hogwarts Legacy](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Legacy "Hogwarts Legacy")_ and _Marvel's Spider-Man 2_.

It has a pro-orientated version in the form of [DualSense Edge](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Controller:DualSense_Edge "Controller:DualSense Edge"), which was released on January 26, 2023.

The DualSense is a generic DirectInput controller, so it is not supported by games that use the XInput API unless XInput wrappers like [Steam Input](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Steam_Input "Steam Input") are used. Some wrappers can expose additional features such as gyroscope, touchpad control including the ability to change lightbar color, and built-in speaker. The DualSense is supported natively in selected games, where features like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback are natively supported (see [support in games](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Controller:DualSense#Support_in_games)), however it is only supported with a wired connection. Audio passthrough to the 3.5mm audio jack also only works when wired.
