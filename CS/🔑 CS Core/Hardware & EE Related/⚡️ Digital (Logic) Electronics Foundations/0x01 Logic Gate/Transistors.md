<small>Shown is a conceptual diagram of a gate-all-around (GAA) field-effect transistor. GAA transistors are the successor to ‚ÄúFin‚Äù transistors (FinFETs) since GAA transistors can work at characteristic length scales below 7 nm. GAA transistors have many 3D interfaces, which poses a challenging boundary value problem during design analysis. <br><a>https://www.nist.gov/image/conceptual-diagram-gate-all-around-gaa-field-effect-transistor</a></small>
