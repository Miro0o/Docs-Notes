### What is ReactiveSwift?
**ReactiveSwift** offers composable, declarative and flexible primitives that are built around the grand concept of ***streams of values over time***. These primitives can be used to uniformly represent common Cocoa and generic programming patterns that are fundamentally an act of observation.

For more information about the core primitives, see [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift).
