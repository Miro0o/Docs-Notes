Docs.rs is an [open source](https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs) documentation host for crates of the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). All libraries published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) are documented. If you just published a crate, your crate is likely still in [the queue](https://docs.rs/releases/queue).

The source code of Docs.rs is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs). If you ever encounter an issue, don't hesitate to report it! (And thanks in advance!)

## Intro
[Getting started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.
