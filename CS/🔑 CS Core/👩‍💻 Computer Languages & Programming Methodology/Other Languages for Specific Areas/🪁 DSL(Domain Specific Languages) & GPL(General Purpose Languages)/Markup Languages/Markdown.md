## Intro
Markdown is a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) developed by John Gruber whose original goal was enabling authors “to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)” (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
