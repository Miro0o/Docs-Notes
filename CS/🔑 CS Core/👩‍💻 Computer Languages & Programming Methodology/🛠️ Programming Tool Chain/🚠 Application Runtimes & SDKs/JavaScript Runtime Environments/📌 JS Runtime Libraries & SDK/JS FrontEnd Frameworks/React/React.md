> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**React** (also known as **React.js** or **ReactJS**) is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) [front-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end) [**JavaScript library**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_library) for building [user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interfaces) based on UI components. 

React is maintained by [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms)(formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. 

React can be used as a base in the development of [single-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like [Next.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js). 

However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model), so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionalities.
