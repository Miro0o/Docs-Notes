WSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process one request.

WSGI is a Python standard described in detail in [**PEP 3333**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333).
