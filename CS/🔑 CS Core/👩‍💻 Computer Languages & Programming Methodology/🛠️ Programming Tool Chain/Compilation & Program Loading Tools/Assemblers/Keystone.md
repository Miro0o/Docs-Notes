## Intro

**Keystone** is a lightweight multi-platform, multi-architecture assembler framework.

Highlight features:
- Multi-architecture, with support for Arm, Arm64 (AArch64/Armv8), Ethereum Virtual Machine, Hexagon, Mips, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ, & X86 (include 16/32/64bit).
- Clean/simple/lightweight/intuitive architecture-neutral API.
- Implemented in C/C++ languages, with bindings for Java, Masm, Visual Basic, C#, PowerShell, Perl, Python, NodeJS, Ruby, Go, Rust, Haskell & OCaml available.
- Native support for Windows & *nix (with Mac OSX, Linux, *BSD & Solaris confirmed).
- Thread-safe by design.
- Open source.

Keystone is based on [LLVM](http://www.llvm.org/), but it goes much further with [a lot more to offer](https://www.keystone-engine.org/docs/beyond_llvm.html).
