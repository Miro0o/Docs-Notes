## Intro

**[What is PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php)**
PHP (recursive acronym for *PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor*) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that ==the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client.== The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. 


**[What can PHP do](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatcando.php)**
1. Server-side scripting.
2. Command line scripting.
3. Writing desktop applications.
