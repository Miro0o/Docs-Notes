Capstone is a disassembly framework with the target of becoming the ultimate disasm engine for binary analysis and reversing in the security community.

Created by Nguyen Anh Quynh, then developed and maintained by a small community, Capstone offers some unparalleled features:
- Support multiple hardware architectures: ARM, AArch64, Alpha, ARC, BPF, Ethereum VM, LoongArch, HP PA-RISC (HPPA), M68K, M680X, Mips, MOS65XX, PPC, RISC-V(rv32G/rv64G), SH, Sparc, SystemZ, TMS320C64X, TriCore, Webassembly, XCore and X86 (16, 32, 64), Xtensa.
- Having clean/simple/lightweight/intuitive architecture-neutral API.
- Provide details on disassembled instruction (called ‚Äúdecomposer‚Äù by others).
- Provide semantics of the disassembled instruction, such as list of implicit registers read & written.
- Implemented in pure C language, with lightweight bindings for Swift, D, Clojure, F#, Common Lisp, Visual Basic, PHP, PowerShell, Emacs, Haskell, Perl, Python, Ruby, C#, NodeJS, Java, GO, C++, OCaml, Lua, Rust, Delphi, Free Pascal & Vala ready either in main code, or provided externally by the community).
- Native support for all popular platforms: Windows, Mac OSX, iOS, Android, Linux, *BSD, Solaris, etc.
- Thread-safe by design.
- Special support for embedding into firmware or OS kernel.
- High performance & suitable for malware analysis (capable of handling various X86 malware tricks).
- Distributed under the open source BSD license.
