## Usage
### Incremental Diff
📂 https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/incremental_diff.html

Sublime Text includes a built-in diff functionality that tracks changes to files being edited. The diff calculation is incremental, tracking each buffer modification as it is performed. It does not require the file be stored in a version control system, such as Git.

The exact location of each addition, modification and deletion is tracked. This is used to display markers in the gutter, allow navigation between each change, display inline diffs and allow for reverting changes.

Diffs are calculated against the version of the file on disk, but [Diff Markers](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/git_integration.html#diff-markers) can be configured to diff against HEAD, and the API allows files to be diffed against any content.
