This document describes the source code for the [Eclipse Paho](http://eclipse.org/paho/) MQTT Python client library, which implements versions 5.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1 of the MQTT protocol.
Paho is an [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/) project.



## Intro
The MQTT protocol is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/”Internet of Things” connectivity protocol. Designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport, it is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
