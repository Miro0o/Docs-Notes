1. **JDK** (Java Development Kit) is a Kit that provides the environment to **develop and execute(run)** the Java program. JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things
	1. Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
	2. JRE (to execute your java program).
2. **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to **only run(not develop)** the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs that are end-users of your system.
3. [JVM (Java Virtual Machine)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an [**i**_**nterpreter**_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-vs-interpreter-2/)**.**

The components of JRE are as follows:
1. **Deployment technologies**, including deployment, Java Web Start, and Java Plug-in.
2. **User interface toolkits**, including _Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), Swing, Java 2D, Accessibility, Image I/O, Print Service, Sound, drag_, _and drop (DnD)_, and _input methods_.
3. **Integration libraries**, including _Interface Definition Language (IDL), Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Remote Method Invocation Over Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (RMI-IIOP)_, and _scripting_.
4. **Other base libraries**, including _international support, input/output (I/O), extension mechanism, Beans, Java Management Extensions (JMX), Java Native Interface (JNI), Math, Networking, Override Mechanism, Security, Serialization_, and _Java for XML Processing (XML JAXP)_.
5. **Lang and util base libraries**, including _lang and util, management, versioning, zip, instrument, reflection, Collections, Concurrency Utilities, Java Archive (JAR), Logging, Preferences API, Ref Objects_, and _Regular Expressions_.
6. **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, including _Java HotSpot Client_ and _Server Virtual Machines_.

JVM becomes an instance of JRE at the runtime of a Java program. It is widely known as a runtime interpreter. JVM largely helps in the abstraction of inner implementation from the programmers who make use of libraries for their programs from JDK. 

_**It is mainly responsible for three activities.**_ 
- Loading
- Linking
- Initialization

**Similarly, now let us discuss the working of JRE which is as follows:**
- **JVM(Java Virtual Machine)** acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications. JVM is the one that actually calls the **main** method present in a java code. JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).
- Java applications are called **WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere)**. This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustments. This is all possible because of JVM.
- When we compile a _.java_ file, _.class_ files(contains byte-code) with the same class names present in _.java_ file are generated by the Java compiler. This _.class_ file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM.
