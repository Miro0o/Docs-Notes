## Intro
Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.

``` shell
#ninja-build` on `irc.oftc.net
```

### Getting Ninja
You can [download the Ninja binary](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) or [find it in your system's package manager](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages).

Or, build from source:

```shell
$ git clone git://github.com/ninja-build/ninja.git && cd ninja
$ git checkout release
$ cat README.md
```
