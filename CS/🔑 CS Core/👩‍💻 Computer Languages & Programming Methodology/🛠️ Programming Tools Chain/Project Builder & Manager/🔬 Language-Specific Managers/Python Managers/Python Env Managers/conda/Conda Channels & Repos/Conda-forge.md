[conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge) is a GitHub organization containing repositories of conda recipes. Thanks to some awesome continuous integration providers (AppVeyor, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI and TravisCI), each repository, also known as a feedstock, automatically builds its own recipe in a clean and repeatable way on Windows, Linux and OSX.



## Intro
### Why conda-forge?
> 🔗 [A brief introduction to conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html)

The conda team, from [Anaconda, Inc.](https://anaconda.org/), packages a multitude of packages and provides them to all users free of charge in their `default` channel.

But what if a package you are looking for is not in the default channel? In the past users only had the option to create an [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/) account and create their own channel.

**conda-forge is a community effort** that tackles these issues:
- All packages are shared in a single channel named `conda-forge`.
- Care is taken that all packages are up-to-date.
- Common standards ensure that all packages have compatible versions.
- By default, we build packages for macOS, Linux AMD64 and Windows AMD64.
- Many packages are updated by multiple maintainers with an easy option to become a maintainer.
- An active core developer team is trying to also maintain abandoned packages.
