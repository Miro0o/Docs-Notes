# PAL (Programmable Array Logic)

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
**Programmable Array Logic (PAL)** chips were the first logic devices that could be configured to provide a variety of logic functions. ==PALs consist of a set of inputs and a set of outputs that are connected by an array of **programmable AND gates** and a **fixed array of OR gates**, as shown in Figure 10.2.== A PAL chipâ€™s outputs give a sum-of-products function of its inputs. The circuit is programmed by blowing fuses or throwing switches within a conductor grid that interconnects the inputs and the AND gates. When a PAL fuse is blown, the AND gate input to which it is connected becomes a logical 0.1 OR gates collect the outputs from the AND gates to complete the function.
