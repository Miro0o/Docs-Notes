👍 [A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks | distill.pub](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/)

> This article is one of two Distill publications about graph neural networks. Take a look at [Understanding Convolutions on Graphs](https://distill.pub/2021/understanding-gnns/) to understand how convolutions over images generalize naturally to convolutions over graphs.

📄 [Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00687)

> The Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) is a collection of realistic, large-scale, and diverse benchmark datasets for machine learning on graphs. OGB datasets are automatically downloaded, processed, and split using the [OGB Data Loader](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/home/#dataloader). The model performance can be evaluated using the [OGB Evaluator](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/home/#evaluator) in a unified manner.   
> 
> OGB is a community-driven initiative in active development. We expect the benchmark datasets to evolve. To keep up to date to major updates, **subscribe to our google group [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-graph-benchmark)**.

## Intro
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is an effort to apply deep learning techniques in graphs. The term GNN is typically referred to a variety of different algorithms and not a single architecture.
