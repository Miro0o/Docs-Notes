## Web Scraping

The goal is to extract data from website.

- Noisy,weaklabels,canbespammy
- Availableatscale
- E.g. price comparison/ trackingwebsite

Many ML datasets are obtained by web scraping 

- E.g. ImageNet,Kinetics

üÜö Web crawling VS scrapping

- Crawling: indexing whole pages on Internet

- Scraping: scraping particular data from webpages of a website



### Tools

- curl
- Headless browser
- Lots of IP



### Python script for web scraping

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Consideration

- Web scraping isn‚Äôt illegal by itself
- But you should
  - NOT scrape data have sensitive information (E.g. private data involving username/ password, personal health/medical information)
- NOT scape copyrighted data(E.g.YouTubevideos,Flickrphotos)
- Follow the Terms of Service that explicitly prohibits webs craping
- Consult a lawyer if you are doing it for profit.
