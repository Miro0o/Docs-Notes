### Roles in ML

- **Domain experts**: have business insights, know what data is important and where to find it, identify the real impact of a ML model,
- **Data scientists**: full stack on data mining, model training and deployment.
- **ML experts**: customize SOTA ML models.
- **SDE (Software develop engineer)**: develop/maintain data pipelines, model training and serving pipelines.

### Preprocessing

#### Regularization

Many machine learning algorithms also require that the selected features are on the same scale for optimal performance, which is often achieved by transforming the features in the range [0, 1] or a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance, as we will see in later chapters.

#### Dimensionality reduction

Some of the selected features may be highly correlated and therefore redundant
 to a certain degree. In those cases, dimensionality reduction techniques are useful for compressing the features onto a lower dimensional subspace



### Training and selecting a predictive model

#### Cross-Validation



#### Hyperparameter Optimization



### Evaluating models and predicting unseen data instances
