Self Organizing Maps or Kohenin’s map is a type of artificial neural networks introduced by [Teuvo Kohonen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teuvo_Kohonen) in the 1980s. (Paper [link](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/pdf/algorithm/articulo/1990-Kohonen-PIEEE.pdf))

SOM is trained using unsupervised learning, it is a little bit different from other artificial neural networks, SOM doesn’t learn by backpropagation with SGD,it use competitive learning to adjust weights in neurons. And we use this type of artificial neural networks in dimension reduction to reduce our data by creating a spatially organized representation, also it help us to discover the correlation between data.
