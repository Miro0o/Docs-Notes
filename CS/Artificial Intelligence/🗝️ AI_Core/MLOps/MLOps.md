**MLOps** or **ML Ops** is a set of practices that **aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.** The word is a compound of "machine learning" and the continuous development practice of [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) in the software field. Machine learning models are tested and developed in isolated experimental systems. When an algorithm is ready to be launched, MLOps is practiced between Data Scientists, DevOps, and Machine Learning engineers to transition the algorithm to production systems. 

Similar to [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) or [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps) approaches, **MLOps seeks to increase automation and improve the quality** of production models, while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements. While MLOps started as a set of best practices, it is slowly evolving into an independent approach to ML lifecycle management. MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle - from integrating with model generation ([software development lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_lifecycle), [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)/[continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)), orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, and business metrics. 

According to [Gartner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner), MLOps is a subset of ‚ÜóÔ∏è [ModelOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModelOps). MLOps is focused on the operationalization of ML models, while ModelOps covers the operationalization of all types of AI model
