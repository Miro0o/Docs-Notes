🔥 [GNN + Community Detection Intro](https://github.com/adrian-lison/gnn-community-detection)

> The goal of this seminar work is to provide an introduction to the principles and functioning of Graph Neural Networks. In order to illustrate some of the subtleties of different approaches, the task of community detection will be used as a practical example of a promising application, where node features and graph structure can be merged into a rich network representation.

## Intro
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is an effort to apply deep learning techniques in graphs. The term GNN is typically referred to a variety of different algorithms and not a single architecture.
