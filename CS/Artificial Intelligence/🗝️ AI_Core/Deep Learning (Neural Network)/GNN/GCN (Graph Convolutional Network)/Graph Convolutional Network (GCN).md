> I am a Senior Research Scientist at Google Brain. I obtained my PhD at the University of Amsterdam working with [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). For my PhD thesis on [Deep Learning with Graph-Structured Representations](https://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/1b63b965-24c4-4bcd-aabb-b849056fa76d) I received the [ELLIS PhD Award 2021](https://ellis.eu/news/ellis-phd-award-2021). I am broadly interested in developing and studying machine learning models that can reason about the rich structure of both the physical and digital world and their combinatorial complexity.
