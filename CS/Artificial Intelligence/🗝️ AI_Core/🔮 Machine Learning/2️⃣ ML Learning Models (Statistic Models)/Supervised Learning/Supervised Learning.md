## Res



## Intro
The main goal in supervised learning is to learn a model from **labeled training data** that allows us to make predictions about unseen or future data. Here, the term "supervised" refers to a set of training examples (data inputs) where the desired output signals (labels) are already known. The following figure summarizes a typical supervised learning workflow, where the labeled training data is passed to a machine learning algorithm for fitting a predictive model that can make predictions on new, unlabeled data inputs:

generate labels from data.

E.g. word2vec, BERT


#### 1️⃣ Classification (Discrete)
Classification is a subcategory of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances, based on past observations. Those class labels are **discrete**, unordered values that can be understood as the group memberships of the instances.

#### 2️⃣ Regression (Continuous)
A second type of supervised learning is the prediction of **continuous outcomes**, which is also called **regression analysis**. In regression analysis, we are given a number of predictor (**explanatory**) variables and a continuous response variable (**outcome**), and we try to find a relationship between those variables that allows us to predict an outcome.

> 💡 The emphases here is **continuous outcomes**, which means the input might still be discrete while the outcome required is continuous.
