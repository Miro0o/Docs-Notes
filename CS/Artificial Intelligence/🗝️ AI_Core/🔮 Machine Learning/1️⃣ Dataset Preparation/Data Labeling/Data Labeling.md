## 1️⃣ Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)
Focus on the scenario where there is a small amount of labeled data, along with large amount of unlabeled data.

SSL makes below assumptions on data distribution to use unlabeled data:

- **Continuity assumption**: examples with similar features are more likely to have the same label.
- **Cluster assumption**:data have inherent cluster structure, examples in the same cluster tend to have the same label.
- **Manifold assumption**:data lie on a manifold of much lower dimension than the input space.


### Self-training

## 2️⃣ Label through Crowdsourcing
### [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com)

Amazon Mechanical Turk is a crowdsourcing website for businesses to hire remotely located "crowdworkers" to perform discrete on-demand tasks that computers are currently unable to do. It is operated under Amazon Web Services, and is owned by Amazon.

e.g. ImageNet

### Challenges
- **Simplify user interaction**: design easy tasks, clear instructions and simple to use interface
  - Needs to find qualified workers for complex jobs (e.g.label medical images)
- **Cost**: reduce  $$tasks \times time$$  per task sent to labelers
- **Quality control**: label qualities generated by different labelers vary


### Reduce \#tasks: Active Learning
Focus on same scenario as SSL but with human in the loop.

- **Self training**: Model helps propagate labels to unlabeled data.
- **Active learning**: Model select the most “**interesting**” data for labelers.


#### Uncertainty sampling
Choose the most uncertaint lable for labelers to label.


#### Query-by-committee
Trains multiple models and select samples that models disagree with.


#### Active Learning + Self Learning

## 3️⃣ Weak Supervision
Semi-automatically generate labels. Less accurate than manual ones, but good enough for training

### Data programming
