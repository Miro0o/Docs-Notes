# SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping)

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. While this initially appears to be a chicken or the egg problem, there are several algorithms known to solve it in, at least approximately, tractable time for certain environments. Popular approximate solution methods include theÂ [particle filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter "Particle filter"), extendedÂ [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter "Kalman filter"), covariance intersection, and GraphSLAM. SLAM algorithms are based on concepts inÂ [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry "Computational geometry")Â andÂ [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"), and are used inÂ [robot navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_navigation "Robot navigation"),Â [robotic mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_mapping "Robotic mapping")Â andÂ [odometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry "Odometry")Â forÂ [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality "Virtual reality")Â orÂ [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality "Augmented reality").

SLAM algorithms are tailored to the available resources and are not aimed at perfection but at operational compliance. Published approaches are employed in self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, planetary rovers, newer domestic robots and even inside the human body.
