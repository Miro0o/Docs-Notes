## Intro
We introduce OpenVoice, a versatile instant voice cloning approach that requires only a short audio clip from the reference speaker to replicate their voice and generate speech in multiple languages. OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, in addition to replicating the tone color of the reference speaker. OpenVoice also achieves zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning for languages not included in the massive-speaker training set. OpenVoice is also computationally efficient, costing tens of times less than commercially available APIs that offer even inferior performance.
