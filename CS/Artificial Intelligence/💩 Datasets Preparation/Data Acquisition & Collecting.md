### Data Augmentations



## Web Scraping
> via python ↗ [Web Scraping](../../../../🔑%20CS_Core/👩‍💻%20Languages%20Programming/Interpreted%20Languages/Python/Python%20Applications/Web%20Scraping/Web%20Scraping.md)


The goal is to extract data from website.
- Noisy, weaklabels, canbespammy
- Available at scale
- E.g. price comparison/ tracking website

Many ML datasets are obtained by web scraping 

- E.g. ImageNet,Kinetics

🆚 Web crawling VS scrapping

- Crawling: indexing whole pages on Internet

- Scraping: scraping particular data from webpages of a website



### Tools
- curl
- Headless browser
- Lots of IP


### Python script for web scraping
↗️ [Web Scraping](../../../../🔑 CS_Core/👩‍💻 Programming Languages/Interpreted Language/Python/Python Application/Web Scraping/Web Scraping.md)



### [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/)

#TODO



### ⚖️ Legal Consideration
- Web scraping isn’t illegal by itself
- But you should
  - NOT scrape data have sensitive information (E.g. private data involving username/ password, personal health/medical information)
- NOT scape copyrighted data(E.g.YouTubevideos,Flickrphotos)
- Follow the Terms of Service that explicitly prohibits webs craping
- Consult a lawyer if you are doing it for profit.
