## Intro
Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. _Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research._

Keras is:
- **Simple** -- but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer _cognitive load_ to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.
- **Flexible** -- Keras adopts the principle of _progressive disclosure of complexity_: simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarily advanced workflows should be _possible_ via a clear path that builds upon what you've already learned.
- **Powerful** -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA, YouTube, or Waymo.
