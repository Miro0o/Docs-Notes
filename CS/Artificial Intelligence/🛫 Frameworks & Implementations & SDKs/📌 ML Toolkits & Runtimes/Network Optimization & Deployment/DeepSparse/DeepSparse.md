## Intro
[![NM Flow](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/raw/7ee5e60f13b1fd321c5282c91e2873b3363ec911/docs/neural-magic-workflow.png)](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/7ee5e60f13b1fd321c5282c91e2873b3363ec911/docs/neural-magic-workflow.png)

[DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) is a CPU inference runtime that takes advantage of sparsity within neural networks to execute inference quickly. Coupled with [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml), an open-source optimization library, DeepSparse enables you to achieve GPU-class performance on commodity hardware.
