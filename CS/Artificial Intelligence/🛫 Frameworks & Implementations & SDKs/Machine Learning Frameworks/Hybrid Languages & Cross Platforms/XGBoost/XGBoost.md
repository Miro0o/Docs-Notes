## Intro
**XGBoost**Â is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highlyÂ **efficient**,Â **flexible**Â andÂ **portable**. It implements machine learning algorithms under theÂ [Gradient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting)framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. The same code runs on major distributed environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.
