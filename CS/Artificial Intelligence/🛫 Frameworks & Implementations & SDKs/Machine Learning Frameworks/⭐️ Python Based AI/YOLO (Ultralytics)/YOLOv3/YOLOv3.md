This blog will provide an exhaustive study of YOLOv3 (You only look once), which is one of the most popular deep learning models extensively used for object detection, semantic segmentation, and image classification. In this blog, I'll explain the architecture of YOLOv3 model, with its different layers, and see some results for object detection that I got while running the inference program on some test images using the model.
