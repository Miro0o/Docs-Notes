## Intro
ntroducing [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com/) [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), the latest version of the acclaimed real-time object detection and image segmentation model. YOLOv8 is built on cutting-edge advancements in deep learning and computer vision, offering unparalleled performance in terms of speed and accuracy. Its streamlined design makes it suitable for various applications and easily adaptable to different hardware platforms, from edge devices to cloud APIs.


### YOLO: A Brief History
[YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) (You Only Look Once), a popular object detection and image segmentation model, was developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi at the University of Washington. Launched in 2015, YOLO quickly gained popularity for its high speed and accuracy.

- [YOLOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242), released in 2016, improved the original model by incorporating batch normalization, anchor boxes, and dimension clusters.
- [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf), launched in 2018, further enhanced the model's performance using a more efficient backbone network, multiple anchors and spatial pyramid pooling.
- [YOLOv4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934) was released in 2020, introducing innovations like Mosaic data augmentation, a new anchor-free detection head, and a new loss function.
- [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) further improved the model's performance and added new features such as hyperparameter optimization, integrated experiment tracking and automatic export to popular export formats.
- [YOLOv6](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6) was open-sourced by [Meituan](https://about.meituan.com/) in 2022 and is in use in many of the company's autonomous delivery robots.
- [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) added additional tasks such as pose estimation on the COCO keypoints dataset.
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) is the latest version of YOLO by Ultralytics. As a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, YOLOv8 builds on the success of previous versions, introducing new features and improvements for enhanced performance, flexibility, and efficiency. YOLOv8 supports a full range of vision AI tasks, including [detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/), [segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/), [pose estimation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/), [tracking](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track/), and [classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/). This versatility allows users to leverage YOLOv8's capabilities across diverse applications and domains.
