We are thrilled to announce the launch of Ultralytics YOLOv8¬†üöÄ, our NEW cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model released at¬†**[https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)**. YOLOv8 is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection, image segmentation and image classification tasks.

See the¬†[YOLOv8 Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)¬†for details and get started with:
```shell
pip install ultralytics
```



## Intro
### Getting Started with YOLOv8
To get started applying YOLOv8 to your own use case, check out our guide on¬†[how to train YOLOv8 on custom dataset](https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-train-yolov8-on-a-custom-dataset/).

To see what others are doing with YOLOv8,¬†[browse Roboflow Universe for other YOLOv8 models](https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov8-models-apis-datasets/), datasets, and inspiration.

For practitioners who are putting their model into production and are using active learning strategies to continually update their model - we have added a pathway where you can¬†[deploy your YOLOv8 model](https://blog.roboflow.com/upload-model-weights-yolov8/), using it in our inference engines and for label assist on your dataset.


### Models Available in YOLOv8
There are five models in each category of YOLOv8 models for detection, segmentation, and classification. YOLOv8 Nano is the fastest and smallest, while YOLOv8 Extra Large (YOLOv8x) is the most accurate yet the slowest among them.

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|YOLOv8n|YOLOv8s|YOLOv8m|YOLOv8l|YOLOv8x|

YOLOv8 comes bundled with the following pre-trained models:
- Object Detection checkpoints trained on the COCO detection dataset with an image resolution of 640.
- Instance segmentation checkpoints trained on the COCO segmentation dataset with an image resolution of 640.
- Image classification models pretrained on the ImageNet dataset with an image resolution of 224.

> The inference runs at almost¬†**105 FPS on a laptop GTX 1060 GPU** for YOLOv8n.
> The Extra Large model (YOLOv8x) runs at an average of 17 FPS on the GTX 1060 GPU.
