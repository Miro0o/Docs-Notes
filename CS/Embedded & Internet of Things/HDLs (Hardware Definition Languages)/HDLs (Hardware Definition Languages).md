# HDLs (Hardware Definition Languages)

## Intro
Direct manual synthesis of logic components is feasible only for very small circuits. Todayâ€™s ASICs consist of hundreds of thousands of gates and millions of transistors. The complexity of these chips escapes human comprehension. Various tools and design languages help manage the complexity, but the constantly increasing gate densities are forcing the design process to a higher plane of abstraction. One of the tools used in dealing with this complexity is the hardware definition language (HDL). 

Hardware definition languages allow a designer to specify circuit behavior on an **algorithmic level**. Instead of thinking about the circuit in terms of gates and wires, a designer works with variables and control structures in a manner similar to working with a second- or third-generation programming language. 

Instead of creating a stream of binary machine code, the HDL source code produces a specification for gates and wires called a **netlist**. The **netlist** is suitable input for the software that ultimately produces the silicon die layout.
