> Your Raspberry Pi needs an operating system to work. This is it. **Raspberry Pi OS** (previously called **Raspbian**) is our official supported operating system.

[Why isn't my Raspberry Pi 64-bit?]:https://support.thepihut.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017234718-Why-isn-t-my-Raspberry-Pi-64-bit-#:~:text=All%20Raspberry%20Pi%204%2FPi,when%20using%20Raspberry%20Pi%20imager.

All Raspberry Pi 4/Pi 400 boards are 64-bit, however they will report themselves as 32-bit when using the normal Raspberry Pi OS as the standard/default operating system is 32-bit.

A 64-bit version of the operating system is also available and can be selected as an option when using [Raspberry Pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

The default 'go-to' image is still the 32-bit version, so this is what we ship with our SD cards and kits.
