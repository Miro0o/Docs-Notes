[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
Graph Mining is the set of tools and techniques used to
1. Analyze the properties of real-world graphs;
2. Predict how the structure and properties of a given graph might affect some application;
3. Develop models that can generate realistic graphs that match the patterns found in real-world graphs of interest.

### Getting Started with Graph Mining and Networks
#### Cora Network


#### Spektral(based on Keras and Tensorflow2)
