## Intro
Graph Mining is the set of tools and techniques used to
1. Analyze the properties of real-world graphs;
2. Predict how the structure and properties of a given graph might affect some application;
3. Develop models that can generate realistic graphs that match the patterns found in real-world graphs of interest.


### Topics in Graph Mining
1. Graph Pattern Mining
	1. Frequent graph patterns  
	2. Pattern summarization  
	3. Optimal graph patterns  
	4. Graph patterns with constraints
	5. Approximate graph patterns 

2. Graph Classification
	1. Pattern-based approach
	2. Decision tree  
	3. Decision stumps 

3. Graph Compression

Other important topics (graph model, laws, graph dynamics, social network analysis, visualization, summarization, graph clustering, link analysis, ...)
