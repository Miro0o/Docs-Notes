## Intro
Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) for SQL and structured data processing, [pandas API on Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/quickstart_ps.html) for pandas workloads, [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html) for machine learning, [GraphX](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html) for graph processing, and [Structured Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) for incremental computation and stream processing.
