This is an attempt to build a locally hosted alternative to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). It uses the [SalesForce CodeGen](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen) models inside of NVIDIA's [Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server) with the [FasterTransformer backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/fastertransformer_backend/).



## 👉 `TurboPilot`
🏠 https://github.com/ravenscroftj/turbopilot

TurboPilot is a self-hosted [copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) clone which uses the library behind [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to run the [6 Billion Parameter Salesforce Codegen model](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen) in 4GiB of RAM. It is heavily based and inspired by on the [fauxpilot](https://github.com/fauxpilot/fauxpilot) project.

> _**NB: This is a proof of concept right now rather than a stable tool. Autocompletion is quite slow in this version of the project. Feel free to play with it, but your mileage may vary. (by this is copied, 2023.4.13)**_



## 👉 `Codeium`
🏠 https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.vim

Copilot for vim/neovim/ other IDEs.
