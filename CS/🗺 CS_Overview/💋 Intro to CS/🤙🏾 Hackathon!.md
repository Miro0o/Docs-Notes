## Intro
> **TL;DR**
> 
> A **hackathon** (also known as a **hack day**, **hackfest**, **datathon** or **codefest**; a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau "Portmanteau") of [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture "Hacker culture") and [marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon "Marathon")) is an event where people engage in rapid and collaborative engineering over a relatively short period of time such as 24 or 48 hours.

A hackathon is an event set up by a company or an organization that wants to get a high-quality solution through collaboration between experts. Hackathon format is often competitive.

For example, an organization wants to design a brand new operating system. It hosts a hackathon that brings together 10 startups or teams of developers.  Each team provides a solution. The jury chooses the best product and hands out a prize.  After the event, the organization may choose to sign a contract with the winning team. 

It's not just the winner, who gets a shot at landing a contract. Many tech companies monitor hackathon activities and buy products or choose new team members on the spot.
