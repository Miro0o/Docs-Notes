# Posix

> Not to be confused with [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix"), [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like"), or [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux").
> differ from Windows NT

⚠️  to understand what is Posix you need to first understand **[what is API](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/ask/26856)**, and the system-level API & user-lever API. 

> The **Portable Operating System Interface** (**POSIX**) is a family of [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization "Standardization") specified by the [IEEE Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society "IEEE Computer Society") for maintaining compatibility between [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system").POSIX defines both the system- and user-level [application programming interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") (API), along with command line [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell") and utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability) with variants of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix "Unix") and other operating systems. 
> + POSIX is also a [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "Trademark") of the IEEE.POSIX is intended to be used by both application and system developers.
+ [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) is similar to [network socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket). 
	
	+ socket is connection between threads, while API is connection between computer and its program.

## Hadoop project 
> Apache Software Foundation

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.
### HBase
> HBase, [[CS entries quick-look#LevelDB|LevelDB]], RocksDB, NoSQL

[HBase](https://hbase.apache.org)(Hadoop Base) is an open-source non-relational distributed database modeled after [[CS entries quick-look#Bigtable|Google's Bigtable]] and written in Java. It is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's[[CS entries quick-look#Apache Hadoop project| Apache Hadoop project]] and runs on top of [HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html) or [Alluxio](https://www.alluxio.io), providing Bigtable-like capabilities for Hadoop.
> Alluxio is an open-sauce virtual distributed file system (VDFS). more on [WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluxio).

## [Apache http server Project](https://httpd.apache.org/#essentials)
The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") was launched in 1995 and it has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996. It has celebrated its 25th birthday as a project in February 2020.

The Apache HTTP Server is a project of [The Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/).


# Google
## Bigtable
[Google Cloud Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable) is a compressed, high-performance, proprietary data storage system built on Google File System, Chubby Lock Service, SSTable and a few other Google technologies. On May 6, 2015, a public version of Bigtable was made available as a service.see more on[ WiKipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigtable)
## LevelDB
[LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.

# CMake
[CMake](https://cmake.org) is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The suite of CMake tools were created by Kitware in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for open-source projects such as ITK and VTK.

# [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/). Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user [community](https://prometheus.io/community). It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company. To emphasize this, and to clarify the project's governance structure, Prometheus joined the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) in 2016 as the second hosted project, after [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

For more elaborate overviews of Prometheus, see the resources linked from the [media](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/media/) section.
