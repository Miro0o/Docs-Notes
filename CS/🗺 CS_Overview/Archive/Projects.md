# [MPEG](https://mpeg.chiariglione.org)

The **Moving Picture Experts Group** (**MPEG**) is an alliance of [working groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_group "Working group") established jointly by [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization") and [IEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission "International Electrotechnical Commission") that sets standards for media coding, including compression coding of [audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_compression_(data) "Audio compression (data)"), [video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_compression "Video compression"), graphics, and [genomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_of_Genomic_Sequencing_Data "Compression of Genomic Sequencing Data") data; and transmission and [file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_format_(digital) "Container format (digital)") for various applications.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_Picture_Experts_Group#cite_note-TMH-2-1) Together with [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Photographic_Experts_Group "Joint Photographic Experts Group"), MPEG is organized under [ISO/IEC JTC 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_JTC_1 "ISO/IEC JTC 1")/[SC 29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_JTC_1/SC_29 "ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29") – _Coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information_ (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29).

MPEG formats are used in various multimedia systems. The most well known older MPEG media formats typically use [MPEG-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1 "MPEG-1"), [MPEG-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2 "MPEG-2"), and [MPEG-4 AVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_AVC "MPEG-4 AVC") media coding and MPEG-2 systems [transport streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_transport_stream "MPEG transport stream") and [program streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_program_stream "MPEG program stream"). Newer systems typically use the MPEG [base media file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_base_media_file_format "ISO/IEC base media file format") and [dynamic streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP "Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP") (a.k.a. [MPEG-DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-DASH "MPEG-DASH")).
