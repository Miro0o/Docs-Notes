## ðŸ‘‰ Tmux Splitting Windows /Resizing Panes

[ðŸ’¡ Split tmux window with same initial command in new tmux pane]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/63838/split-tmux-window-with-same-initial-command-in-new-tmux-pane

[`#{pane_start_command}`](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1)Â is a way to access the command used to start the current pane. This is available since v1.7 (10/2012).

`bind-key S run-shell "tmux split-window \"#{pane_start_command}\""`  
is a solution for your question usingÂ `#{pane_start_command}`. (`tmux`Â version >= 1.9 (02/2014)).

With versions 1.7 >= X < 1.9 you can use something like this in yourÂ `~/tmux.conf`Â file:
```
bind-key S run-shell "tmux split-window \"$(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_start_command}')\""
```

- The substitutedÂ `display-message`Â command extractsÂ `#{pane_start_command}`.
- That command is given as an argument toÂ `tmux split-window`.

`pane_start_command`Â will be the empty string if the pane was started without a command string and there was noÂ `default-command`, but that is okay becauseÂ `split-window`Â will start a plain login shell if it is given an empty command string.



[ðŸ’¡ Tmux splitting a parent window with existing panes | SuperUser]: https://superuser.com/questions/643473/tmux-splitting-a-parent-window-with-existing-panes

Try this:Â `:splitw -v -f`

According to this description:

> The -f option creates a new pane spanning the full window height (with -h) or full window width (with -v), instead of splitting the active pane.

I guess it is still not as versitle as the "parent pane" design, but will solve many less complicated layouts easily.

#flipping the orientation of the current pane with the pane <arrow-way>-of

bind -n S-Up move-pane -h -t '.{up-of}'

bind -n S-Left move-pane -t '.{left-of}'

here are my example to change the otiantation with the pane in the way of the arrow only Press Shift and Arrow-key or rebind the command how you want



[ðŸ’¡ How do I resize tmux pane by holding down prefix and arrow key for a while?]: https://superuser.com/questions/1560523/how-do-i-resize-tmux-pane-by-holding-down-prefix-and-arrow-key-for-a-while

By default these bindings (among others) are active:

## ðŸ‘‰ Set Keybindings in Byobu

You're so close! You're just missing the capitalization of "R" in M-Right and "L" in M-Left.

Just add the following toÂ `~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux`:

```
unbind -n M-Right
unbind -n M-Left
```

And then pressÂ F5Â to reload your profile.


[Disable keybindings in byobu using tmux backend | AskUbuntu]: https://askubuntu.com/a/330545


you will find these lines :
```
bind-key -n M-Left previous-window
bind-key -n M-Right next-window
```

`M`Â is forÂ _Meta_, aka theÂ _ALT key_. Example. Change the lines for :
```
bind-key -n C-Left previous-window
bind-key -n C-Right next-window
```

`C`Â forÂ _Ctrl key_Â (andÂ `S`Â forÂ _Shift key_).

## ðŸ‘‰ `bat` cannot interpret `$()` expression in config file & cannot interpret theme name like `Sublime Snazzy` with space
#bat

I want to config `bat` to adjust theme according to macOS system light/dark themes following official docs via this commands:
```shell
alias cat="bat --theme=\$(defaults read -globalDomain AppleInterfaceStyle &> /dev/null && echo default || echo GitHub)"
```

My practice is i put following into `bat` config file located at `~/.config/bat/config`:
```shell
# Set the theme to "TwoDark"
--theme="\$(defaults read -globalDomain AppleInterfaceStyle &> /dev/null && echo 'Sublime Snazzy' || echo 'Solarized (light)')"

# Show line numbers, Git modifications and file header (but no grid)
--style="numbers,changes,header"

# Use italic text on the terminal (not supported on all terminals)
# --italic-text=always

# Use C++ syntax for Arduino .ino files
--map-syntax "*.ino:C++"
```

The problem is it seems that this `bat` config file cannot process the `$()` expression within it (which i found inexplicable). 
I also tried these expressions:
```shell
# Set the theme to "TwoDark"
--theme=$(defaults read -globalDomain AppleInterfaceStyle &> /dev/null && echo 'Sublime Snazzy' || echo 'Solarized (light)')

# Set the theme to "TwoDark"
--theme=$(defaults read -globalDomain AppleInterfaceStyle &> /dev/null && echo 'Sublime Snazzy' || echo 'Solarized (light)')
```
Then i got error report says:
```shell
error: unexpected argument '-g' found

  note: to pass '-g' as a value, use '-- -g'

Usage: bat [OPTIONS] [FILE]...
       bat <COMMAND>

For more information, try '--help'.
```

I have no clue what went wrong. So i change it to the `~/.zshrc` as official doc suggests:
```shell
alias bat="bat --theme=\$(defaults read -globalDomain AppleInterfaceStyle &> /dev/null && echo 'Sublime Snazzy' || echo 'Solarized (light)')"
```

This time the error says:
```shell
[bat warning]: Unknown theme 'Sublime', using default.
```
It can not recognize the theme 'Sublime Snazzy' even if I wrap it with `''`. (this naming with two seperate words is also stupid..)

So finally i change it to this:
```shell
alias bat="bat --theme=\$(defaults read -globalDomain AppleInterfaceStyle &> /dev/null && echo default || echo GitHub)"
```
Then no reports....


TBD..
