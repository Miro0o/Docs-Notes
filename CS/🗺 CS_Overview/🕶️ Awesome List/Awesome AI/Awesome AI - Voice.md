## Intro

### Real Time Voice Cloning
ðŸš§ https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning

This repository is an implementation ofÂ [Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf)Â (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. This was myÂ [master's thesis](https://matheo.uliege.be/handle/2268.2/6801).

SV2TTS is a deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text.
