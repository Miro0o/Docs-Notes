## 👉 Next.js OpenAI Doc Search Starter
This starter takes all the `.mdx` files in the `pages` directory and processes them to use as custom context within [OpenAI Text Completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion) prompts.

Deploy this starter to Vercel. The Supabase integration will automatically set the required environment variables and configure your [Database Schema](https://github.com/supabase-community/nextjs-openai-doc-search/blob/main/supabase/migrations/20230406025118_init.sql). All you have to do is set your `OPENAI_KEY` and you're ready to go!
