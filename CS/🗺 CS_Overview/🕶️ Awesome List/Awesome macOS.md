> A curated list of awesome applications, software, tools and shiny things for macOS.



## Third Party App Markets
If you come across websites offering pirated software or cracks, please post [HERE](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac/issues/17). We love apps, but only authentic ones. :)

- [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) - The best apps for Mac in one suite.


#### Package Managers

*Here are some of the major software download sites, there are a number of OSX Mac software sites*
### Genuine Sites
- [alternativeTo](http://alternativeto.net/) - Also a very nice community. If you are looking for some alternative apps **FOR** Windows or another platform, check this site.
- [Slant](https://www.slant.co/) - I personally recommend this. This is a platform where you can compare apps side-by-side, you might get an idea by seeing other users recommendations. Please contribute if you find an application from this list!
- Also, [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), you know the drill.
- App Shopper：http://appshopper.com/
- MacUpdate：https://www.macupdate.com/
- Other sites like [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/), [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/), [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/topics/mac) are great resources.

[Macintosh Repository](https://www.macintoshrepository.org)

> If you're planning on running the treasures of the past you'll find here on real old Macintosh hardware from the 90's, you sir/madame, deserve to win an Internet for doing it THE ONLY CORRECT WAY! But for others, there's [QEMU, a PowerPC emulator](http://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=9028&p=53807#p53788) capable of (slowly) running Mac OS X 10.5 down to Mac OS 9.1, [SheepShaver, a fake PowerPC emulator](http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/) capable of running Mac OS 9.0.4 down to Mac OS 7.5.2, [Basilisk II, a 68040 emulator](http://basilisk.cebix.net/), capable of running Mac OS 8.1 down to 7.0. Finally, for everything older than System 7, there's [Mini vMac](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/).   
> Quick tip about Basilisk II if you do not have a real old Mac: v1.4.2 from 2008 can read/write high density (1.4MB) Mac floppy disks using a normal PC floppy drive! I salvaged many old files using it while 5 different Windows apps failed at the task. I highly recommend backing up all your floppy disks using Basilisk II before it's too late!


### Pirated software download site blacklist
*Refuse piracy from me. Software vendors can go to these places rights.*
