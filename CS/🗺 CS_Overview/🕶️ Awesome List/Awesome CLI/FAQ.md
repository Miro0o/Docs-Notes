## ðŸ‘‰ [How to disable/enable mouse copy while keeping mouse scroll in tmux?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62544783/how-to-disable-mouse-copy-while-keeping-mouse-scroll-in-tmux)

1. set mouse mode to enable mouse scroll. 
2. Above setting disenables copy text. To copy text from buffer press `option` key.

A possible helpful tmux config :

```shell
set -g mouse on
unbind-key MouseDown2Pane
unbind-key MouseDragEnd1Pane
bind-key -n MouseDown2Pane run "tmux set-buffer \"$(xclip -o -sel primary)\"; tmux paste-buffer"
bind-key -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "xclip -sel primary -i"
set -g set-clipboard external
```

## ðŸ‘‰ Tmux Splitting Windows /Resizing Panes
[ðŸ’¡ Split tmux window with same initial command in new tmux pane]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/63838/split-tmux-window-with-same-initial-command-in-new-tmux-pane

[`#{pane_start_command}`](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1)Â is a way to access the command used to start the current pane. This is available since v1.7 (10/2012).

`bind-key S run-shell "tmux split-window \"#{pane_start_command}\""`  
is a solution for your question usingÂ `#{pane_start_command}`. (`tmux`Â version >= 1.9 (02/2014)).

With versions 1.7 >= X < 1.9 you can use something like this in yourÂ `~/tmux.conf`Â file:
```
bind-key S run-shell "tmux split-window \"$(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_start_command}')\""
```

- The substitutedÂ `display-message`Â command extractsÂ `#{pane_start_command}`.
- That command is given as an argument toÂ `tmux split-window`.

`pane_start_command`Â will be the empty string if the pane was started without a command string and there was noÂ `default-command`, but that is okay becauseÂ `split-window`Â will start a plain login shell if it is given an empty command string.



[ðŸ’¡ Tmux splitting a parent window with existing panes | SuperUser]: https://superuser.com/questions/643473/tmux-splitting-a-parent-window-with-existing-panes

Try this:Â `:splitw -v -f`

According to this description:

> The -f option creates a new pane spanning the full window height (with -h) or full window width (with -v), instead of splitting the active pane.

I guess it is still not as versitle as the "parent pane" design, but will solve many less complicated layouts easily.



[ðŸ’¡ Tmux: Switch the split style of two adjacent panes]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15439294/tmux-switch-the-split-style-of-two-adjacent-panes
```
#flipping the orientation of the current pane with the pane <arrow-way>-of

bind -n S-Up move-pane -h -t '.{up-of}'
bind -n S-Right move-pane -t '.{right-of}'
bind -n S-Left move-pane -t '.{left-of}'
bind -n S-down move-pane -h -t '.{down-of}'
```

here are my example to change the otiantation with the pane in the way of the arrow only Press Shift and Arrow-key or rebind the command how you want



[ðŸ’¡ How do I resize tmux pane by holding down prefix and arrow key for a while?]: https://superuser.com/questions/1560523/how-do-i-resize-tmux-pane-by-holding-down-prefix-and-arrow-key-for-a-while

By default these bindings (among others) are active:

```
bind-key -r -T prefix       M-Up              resize-pane -U 5
bind-key -r -T prefix       M-Down            resize-pane -D 5
bind-key -r -T prefix       M-Left            resize-pane -L 5
bind-key -r -T prefix       M-Right           resize-pane -R 5
bind-key -r -T prefix       C-Up              resize-pane -U
bind-key -r -T prefix       C-Down            resize-pane -D
bind-key -r -T prefix       C-Left            resize-pane -L

...etc



## ðŸ‘‰ Set Keybindings in Byobu
You're so close! You're just missing the capitalization of "R" in M-Right and "L" in M-Left.

Just add the following toÂ `~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux`:

```
unbind -n M-Right
unbind -n M-Left
```

And then pressÂ F5Â to reload your profile.


[Disable keybindings in byobu using tmux backend | AskUbuntu]: https://askubuntu.com/a/330545


you will find these lines :
```
bind-key -n M-Left previous-window
bind-key -n M-Right next-window
```

`M`Â is forÂ _Meta_, aka theÂ _ALT key_. Example. Change the lines for :
```
bind-key -n C-Left previous-window
bind-key -n C-Right next-window
```

`C`Â forÂ _Ctrl key_Â (andÂ `S`Â forÂ _Shift key_).
