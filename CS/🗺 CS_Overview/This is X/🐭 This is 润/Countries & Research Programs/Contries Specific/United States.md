The highest priority of the Bureau of Consular Affairs is to protect the lives and serve the interests of U.S. citizens abroad.  Across the globe, we serve our fellow citizens during some of their most important moments – births, adoptions, medical emergencies, deaths, arrests, and disasters.  We also help U.S. citizens connect with the world by issuing millions of U.S. passports each year.
