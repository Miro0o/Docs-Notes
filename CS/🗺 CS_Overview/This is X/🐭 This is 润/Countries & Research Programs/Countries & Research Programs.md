A grade-point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) or a comparable GPA in upper-division work—junior- and senior-level courses—and in any graduate work already completed is required.

Applicants admitted to the Department of Computer Science graduate program usually have shown their skills in CS by achieving a better than average GPA in their CS courses.

**Official Test Scores (GRE, TOEFL/IELTS)**
-  [GRE General Test](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about/?WT.ac=grehome_greabout_a_150213) scores (**optional for Fall 2024**)*
    - There is no minimum GRE test score, however applicants admitted to the Computer Science graduate program usually have high quantitative GRE scores and a math background that includes study through some discrete math.
-  [TOEFL](https://www.ets.org/toefl/) or [IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/) score for international applicants**
    - The minimum scores considered acceptable for admission by the Graduate School are:

https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/ms-computer-and-information-technology

[Admissions Requirements](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/ms-computer-and-information-technology/admissions)
The admissions process selects highly qualified applicants into the MS program by considering each of the following criteria in judging the overall strength of the applicant. Typically, no single criterion is used as a sole determinant for admission.

- A relevant, earned baccalaureate degree in computer science, information technology, computer engineering, information systems, informatics, or other computer-related field of study. Minimally, students should have earned 15-18 credit hours of computational coursework. Students with insufficient academic preparation, in the faculty’s judgment, may be conditionally admitted but required to develop additional computing competencies by enrolling in designated undergraduate courses prior to undertaking their graduate study.
- An undergraduate grade point average of 3.00 or better (on a 4.00 scale) from accredited institutions is required for unconditional admission.
- Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores at or above the 50th percentile (for each test subsection) are required for unconditional admission. There is no minimum score expectation. The GRE is not waived for admission to this program.
- Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required for international applicants whose first language is not English and who have not graduated from a university or college using English as the language of instruction. The following minimum scores are required for the Internet-based TOEFL:  Overall 90, Reading 20, Listening 20, Speaking 20, and Writing 20. For the paper-based TOEFL, the minimum score is 600.
- Demonstration of a high level of competence in written communication as evidenced by a writing sample such as the statement of purpose, a prior thesis, a research paper, or other significant and personally written product.
- Personal and professional characteristics commensurate with success in the computer and information technology profession.

Note: the faculty evaluators may also require a personal interview, usually by phone.
