   In other words, they don‚Äôt have their own data but they depend on other sources (like Yelp, Bing, Yahoo, and StackOverflow) to provide answers to users‚Äô questions

   Formerly known as Ask Jeeves, [**Ask.com**](https://www.ask.com/) receives approximately 0.42% of the search share. ASK is based on a question/answer format where most questions are answered by other users or are in the form of polls.

   It also has the general search functionality but the results returned lack quality compared to Google or even Bing and Yahoo.

8. [Ecosia](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#ecosia)

   [**Ecosia**](https://www.ecosia.org/) is a Berlin-based social business founded by Christian Kroll in 2009. The main reason ecosia was created was to help in financing planting trees and restoration projects. It is thus known as the ‚Äútree planting search engine‚Äù.

   How does ecosia work? Ecosia is a Bing partner, meaning that its search results are powered by Bing. Ecosia makes money to support the planning of trees by displaying ads in their search results. Every time an ad is clicked, ecosia gets a small share. It is estimated that it takes approx 45 searches to finance the planting of one tree.
