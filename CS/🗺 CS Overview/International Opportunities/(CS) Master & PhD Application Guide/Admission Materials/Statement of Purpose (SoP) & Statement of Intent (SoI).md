本文将讲解留学申请中的动机信，英文 Motivation Letter 或 Letter of Motivation。
本文主要分为五节：
1. 第一节：解释动机信的含义。本节首先会展示三个申请项目对于动机信的要求，随后我将根据我的申请经验来总结动机信的格式和内容。如果你对“动机信”一词毫无了解，那么本节可以帮助你对“动机信”建立一个基础且正确的印象。
2. 第二节：解释动机信的内容和格式。本节将沿用第一部分的总结，逐段讲述注意事项和撰写思路。
3. 第三节：本人动机信案例讲解。本节我会使用我的一封动机信成稿作为案例，逐句讲解我的全文构思、撰写思路，以及其中琐碎的的写作技巧；并且我会尽量将这种思路总结为一种较为通用的模板，以便大家参考。
4. 第四节：多个项目的动机信。申请多个项目时并不需要为每个项目都写一封动机信，而是基于一个通稿，根据项目具体内容修改其中一两段。本节我将使用我的两封动机信，讲解我根据两个项目的差异而对动机信的修改内容和修改思路。
5. 第五节：该思路的其他应用。虽然本文讲述的是动机信写作思路，但是其适用性远不止“动机信”这一个文书；其他常见文书和奇奇怪怪的文笔材料也可以套用。

- #### Personal statement/statement of purpose
    Concisely discuss your computer science educational, research, or industrial background as they relate to your objectives. Include any unique experiences relevant to the research you have done. Discuss why you are applying to the University of Minnesota. Please include names of faculty members and research groups at the University of Minnesota whose research is of interest to you. Use this area to list any extenuating circumstances such as poor grades or test scores. (4000 character limit strongly recommended; does not include spaces, not strictly enforced)
- #### Diversity Statements
    This is only required of domestic applicants. A 4000-character limit (not including spaces) is recommended. International applicants do not need to complete this statement, but they are welcome to complete a statement.  
      
    The statement should cover how your background, experiences, and achievements will contribute to the University's and our Department’s goal of promoting excellence through diversity and inclusion. If applicable, you should mention hardships or obstacles you have overcome to complete your undergraduate education. Some University of Minnesota graduate student applicants will be considered for funding opportunities, like the [DOVE Fellowship](https://grad.umn.edu/funding/program-requests-nominations/nominations/diversity-of-views-experience-fellowship-dove), based on their diversity statement.  
      
    Potential areas to address include:
    
    - Hardships you have faced and overcome;
    - Family background;
    - First-generation college student;
    - Non-traditional attributes for computer science/data science;
    - Your lived experience as influenced, informed, or affected by your diverse identities;
    - Your commitment to working toward achieving equity and enhancing diversity within the field of computing, STEM, or within your community;
    - Geographic diversity;
    - Community involvement;
    - Multilingual skills;
    - International travel which changed your perspective;
    - Special talents; and
    - Anything unique you would contribute to the program.
