The reasons why deer keeps their antlers have long been undecided. In the reading it draws out three plausible explanations concerning this phenomenon, while the lecture invalidates of these three propositions. 

First, the reading suggests that the antler of deers servers as a way of heat dissipation. It argues that because antlers contain many blood vessels, having such enormous blood flowing through it can increase the wind's cooling effect and thus maintain deer's temperture at a constant moderate level. The lecture counters this saying that deers grow antler even longer in winter, making the proposition invalid. Also, according to the lecture, in the earth's hotter regions the length of deers' antlers are yet shorter, while in those cooler regions the antler longer.

Second, the reading suggests another speculation that the antler is evolved to be used as a defensive weapon for deers in face of predator. In the reading it mentions examples of bulls and male goats using their horns to fight back attackers. The lecture, on the other hand, denied this. It points out that the female deers, the ones that mostly need such a defensive mechanism because of their parental duties, actually don't possess antlers at all. On the other hand, evidences show that when facing wolves, the common predator of deers, deers seem to kick them, instead of using antlers, to protect themselves. 

Lastly, the reading suggest a third position of antlers that it is actually used for marking male deer's power and masculinity, granting them dominance, as well as deterring other deers. In the lecture the speaker does admit that deers confront each other and one side would retreat when the meet, but she also points out that there is no evidence showing that this is because the size of one's antler outrunning another. There are also examples where deer with bigger antlers passes away in an confrontation, indicating that they are not imposing dominance by their horns. 
##### Ex.2
The purpose of Ireland's prestigious "Irish round towers" has long been a mystery. The reading introduces three theories explaining its intention, while the lecture denies all of them.

First, according to the reading, "Irish round towers" were built as forts, defending residents against invaders like the Vikings of Scandinavia. This is because these towers provide an ideal place for people to hide and wait during the war time, not only for its fortitudes but also its highly located entrances. The lecture opposed this explanation, saying that such design is simply a structural necessity, not military consideration. Buildings like this tower need high foundations, while the Irish round tower didn't adapt the design of underground foundations, it uses soils and stones piling inside the basement of the tower, making its entrance inevitably high above the ground. 

Second, the reading proposes that another reason for Irish round towers is that they could serve as bell towers, since bell towers are prevalent among European towns at that time. Plus, there's a high chance that the Irish tower once housed metal bells inside it, making its bell sound spreading far distances. The resemblance between the pronunciation of "bell house" and the traditional name for the towers in the Irish language adds plausibility to this explanation as well. However, in lecture's defense, it argues that the Irish tower is unlikely built as bell towers because all above points made by the reading lack evidences. There's now evidence showing that there was a metal bell in the tower. In addition, the traditional Irish language of "stone house" also sounds like the name of the towers, making it difficult to decide weather the name of tower really links to either interpretation. 

Lastly, the reading gives a third reason that the Irish round towers are actually built for watchtowers for its obvious altitude. Still, the lecture objects this argument via some facts concerning the tower. First, the location of the towers are often at a lower position, surrounding by hills which could block the view of it, providing it were a watchtower. Second, the windows of the tower is not only limited in number, but also confined in directions. All these facts preclude the possibility of those towers being used for watchtowers.

(AI rated: 23 ~ 25 /30)
The authenticity and accuracy of the valuable memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt as historical source concerning eighteenth century European society has been questioned by critics. While the reading lays out three examples of such criticisms, the lecture refutes all of them.

First, the reading raises doubts on financial conditions of Chevalier. The reading says it's dubious that Chevalier is as opulent as it appears in throwing parties and gambling, as evidences demonstrating considerable sums of money he borrowed from a Swiss merchant. The lecture refutes such concern, arguing the connection between loans and penury is actually only plausible. Because loans provide financial flexibility, allowing times in property selling and cash revenue. So borrowing money doesn't necessarily links Chevalier with poverty. 

Second, the reading questioned the accuracy of details occurring in Chevalier's writing about Voltaire, a famous scholar. The reading argues that there's a long time span between the actual conversation of the two and the writing, rendering it impossible to restore details in conversations. The lecture denies this accusation, revealing that Chevalier had in fact kept notes of his nightly conversation with Voltaire, and it's easy for him to refer back to those notes when later writing his memoir about the prestigious philosopher. 

Lastly, the reading proposes a third loophole countering the credibility of Chevalier's memoir, saying that in an account of Chevalier's escape from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy, Chevalier can barely achieve what he claimed he had done, namely escaping from the prison by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof. The critics believe it's more credible if he bribed the jailers. Still, the lecture objects these reasons for several facts. First, there're more prisoners who are actually more connected with jailers than Chevalier, so if he can escape by bribery, others can as well. But Chevalier is the only one who've successfully escaped. Second, as soon as Chevalier escaped, the prison repaired the whole he made on the ceiling, making it contradictory to the claim that he climbed out from it.

The authenticity and accuracy of Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir as a historical source concerning 18th-century European society have been questioned by critics. While the reading presents three arguments that cast doubt on the memoir's reliability, the lecture systematically refutes each of these points.

First, the reading questions Chevalier's financial status, suggesting that it is doubtful he was as wealthy as he claimed, given evidence that he frequently borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. The lecture counters this by explaining that borrowing money does not necessarily indicate poverty. According to the professor, wealthy individuals often took out loans to manage their liquidity, allowing them time to sell assets or invest in other ventures. Therefore, Chevalier’s borrowing could simply reflect financial strategy, not destitution.

Second, the reading casts doubt on the accuracy of Chevalier's recollection of conversations with Voltaire, a renowned scholar, given the significant time lapse between their discussions and the writing of the memoir. The lecture, however, reveals that Chevalier had meticulously recorded these conversations in his notes each night after speaking with Voltaire. These notes allowed him to accurately reconstruct their dialogues later, ensuring the memoir's fidelity to the actual events.

Lastly, the reading criticizes the account of Chevalier's dramatic escape from a Venetian prison, arguing that it is unlikely he escaped by making a hole in the ceiling and climbing through the roof, as he claimed. Critics believe it is more plausible that he bribed the guards. However, the lecture refutes this by pointing out two key facts: first, other prisoners, who had better connections with the guards than Chevalier, failed to escape through bribery; and second, historical records show that the prison officials repaired the hole in the ceiling shortly after his escape, lending credibility to Chevalier's story.

In summary, while the reading casts doubts on the reliability of Chevalier's memoir, the lecture effectively dismisses these concerns, reinforcing the historical accuracy of his accounts.

The authenticity of Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir as a historical source on 18th-century European society has been questioned by critics. While the reading raises three doubts about its accuracy, the lecture counters each point, defending the memoir's reliability.

First, the reading casts doubt on Chevalier's wealth, pointing to evidence that he borrowed money from a Swiss merchant. However, the lecture explains that borrowing money does not imply poverty. Wealthy individuals often took loans to manage their assets and cash flow. Therefore, Chevalier’s borrowing could be a sign of financial strategy rather than financial trouble, supporting his claims of wealth.

Second, the reading argues that Chevalier’s recollections of his conversations with the philosopher Voltaire are unreliable due to the long time gap between the conversations and the memoir’s writing. The lecture refutes this by revealing that Chevalier kept detailed notes of his nightly discussions with Voltaire. These records allowed him to later write about the conversations with accuracy.

Finally, the reading questions Chevalier's account of his escape from a Venetian prison, suggesting that bribery, rather than physically escaping through the roof, was more likely. The lecture rejects this claim with two key arguments. First, other prisoners with better connections to the guards failed to escape, making bribery an unlikely explanation. Second, official documents from the time show that the prison repaired a hole in the ceiling after Chevalier’s escape, supporting his version of events.

In conclusion, while the reading casts doubt on Chevalier’s memoir, the lecture convincingly counters these criticisms, reinforcing the memoir's credibility as a historical document.

Paleontologists has long wondered wheather giant pterosaurs were able to flight via their elongated wingspan. The reading posits three arguments against such hyposithesis, while the lecture claiming that possibilities still remains.

First, some scientists believe that there's a high chance that pterosaurs are cold-blooded, as many its kindred reptiles peers, thus rendering their wings unlikely powerful enough to fly, since such energy-consuming activities require active metabolism that usually poccessed by warm-blooded animals. The lecture counters this argument, suggesting that pterosaurs is very likely covered by dense fur or feathers, which significantly decreases heat dissipition, as recent focil discovery reveals. Thus it's still possible that pterosaurs actually could generate enough energy for powered flight.

Second, the reading casts doubts on Pterosaur's heavy weight, pointing out that theoretically animials fail to keep airborne with such big body. The lecture, however, refutes this question, explaining that autonomical analysis actually finds that the bones of Pterosaurs are hollowed, which significantly lightened its weight despite of its giant body frame, making it possible for them to be light enough to fly.

Finally, the reading questions Pterosaurs' liability to take off from the ground, since this is critical for animals to fly into the air. Still, the lecture rejects this questions, suggesting that unlike normal birds who use two hinder legs to jump into the air, Pterosaurs actually use all four limbs to push them off from the ground. There's no trouble for them to muster necessary push power using these limbs to lift themselves.

(AIGC version, 30/30)

Paleontologists have long debated whether giant pterosaurs were capable of flight due to their large wingspan. The reading provides three arguments against this idea, but the lecture counters each point, suggesting that flight was still possible for pterosaurs.

First, the reading argues that pterosaurs, being cold-blooded like other reptiles, likely lacked the necessary energy for powered flight. However, the lecture points out that fossil evidence indicates pterosaurs may have had fur or feathers, which would have helped conserve body heat, enabling them to maintain the high metabolism needed for flight.

Second, the reading questions whether pterosaurs’ large size would have prevented them from flying. The lecture rebuts this by explaining that pterosaurs had hollow bones, which significantly reduced their weight, making flight feasible despite their massive frame.

Finally, the reading doubts pterosaurs’ ability to take off due to their size. The lecture rejects this, noting that unlike birds, pterosaurs used all four limbs to launch themselves into the air, providing the necessary power for takeoff.

(another AIGC version, 30/30)
Paleontologists have long debated whether giant pterosaurs could actually fly given their immense wingspans. While the reading presents three reasons to doubt this ability, the lecture effectively challenges these points, suggesting that flight was indeed possible for pterosaurs.

First, the reading posits that pterosaurs were likely cold-blooded like many reptiles, making them incapable of generating the metabolic energy required for flight. However, the lecture counters this by highlighting fossil evidence that shows pterosaurs were covered in fur or feathers. This insulation would have helped retain body heat, enabling them to maintain a higher metabolic rate similar to warm-blooded animals, thus supporting powered flight.

Second, the reading argues that the pterosaur's large body mass would have made flight impossible. Yet, the lecture refutes this by noting that pterosaurs had hollow bones, significantly reducing their weight. This adaptation allowed them to stay light enough to remain airborne despite their considerable size.

Finally, the reading doubts pterosaurs’ ability to take off due to their sheer size, suggesting that it would be impossible for them to launch into the air. The lecture rejects this claim by explaining that, unlike birds that use only two hind limbs for takeoff, pterosaurs employed all four limbs to push off from the ground. This unique method provided the necessary force to lift their large bodies into the air.

In conclusion, while the reading casts doubt on pterosaurs' ability to fly, the lecture persuasively counters each argument, reinforcing the idea that these ancient creatures were indeed capable of flight.

I believe literacy and aesthetic education are equally important to students as practical knowledge.

First, language is the most fundamental ability of human beings, or even a defining trait of human to be what we are. Hence, by learning fiction texts students are actually honing there language skill, improving aesthetic appreciations, which poses a long-lasting, personality shaping effect to them, comparing to the short term benefits brought by learning practical, nonfiction texts. I believe when choosing their pedagogies, it's more reasonable for school to shape students spirits, acting like a bacon lighting their directions, instead of only indoctrinating practical knowledge into them.

Still, some might claim that students learn practical, nonfiction texts from school so that they are more prepared after graduating, in the face of the real world. However, school cannot teach students every skill and knowledge they need in the future. Instead preparing for them with scenario-specific, practical knowledge, teaching the meta knowledge, for instance appreciation of aesthetics by learning literature, seems to be a wiser strategy. 
##### Ex.2
(My writing)
(AI score: 20/30)

Personally, I prefer having no fixed schedule for the time off from school. Like mentioned by Kelly, no plans for the day off provides maximal flexibility and relaxation to a person. For example, when I took the day off, having no pre-decided schedule that day gives me the most flexibility to spend the time. Because I have full control of doing or not doing things that day, it is such state of in charge that really makes me feel unwinded, rather than obtaining pleasure by actually doing something.

Still, some would argue that planning in advance ensures our maximal use of the time and improve the efficiency of the day. However, the purpose of having day off is to recharge oneself, to better prepare oneself for the future "real" works. So under this context it doesn't matter if someone really achieve something during the break. The rest and pease someone gaining from it matters. And by having a day of totally no plan, I gain my rest the most.

(AI score: 26/30)

Personally, I prefer having no fixed schedule during my time off from school. As Kelly mentioned, a day without plans offers maximum flexibility and relaxation. For example, when I take a day off, not having a predetermined agenda allows me to use my time freely. This sense of control makes me feel relaxed, rather than seeking pleasure through activities.

Some may argue that planning ensures we make the most of our time and increases efficiency. However, the purpose of a day off is to recharge and prepare for future responsibilities. In this context, it’s irrelevant whether we achieve specific tasks during our break. What truly matters is the rest and peace we gain from it. By having a completely unplanned day, I achieve the deepest sense of relaxation.

(AI score: 28/30)
When it comes to time off from school or work, I strongly prefer an unstructured approach. As Kelly pointed out, having no fixed plans allows for maximum flexibility and relaxation. For example, on my days off, I relish the freedom to choose how to spend my time. This sense of control fosters a deeper relaxation, enabling me to unwind completely rather than feeling pressured to complete scheduled activities.
 
While some argue that planning ensures we make the most of our time, I believe the primary purpose of time off is to recharge. Resting without a predetermined agenda allows for spontaneous enjoyment, whether that means indulging in a favorite hobby or simply lounging at home. This unstructured time ultimately provides the peace and restoration necessary for returning to work or school rejuvenated. In essence, the value of a day off lies not in productivity but in the quality of rest and personal fulfillment it offers. Thus, I advocate for embracing unplanned days to enhance overall well-being.

(AI generated)
(AI score: 30/30)
In the discussion about structured versus unstructred time off, I believe that planning is more beneficial. Structured time allows individuals to maximize their experiences and engage meaningfully in activities. For example, when visiting family, having a plan ensures that I can spend quality time with each member, fostering deeper connections. Without a plan, valuable moments can slip away, leading to regret. 

Additionally, planning reduces decision fatigue. Knowing what to do ahead of time helps focus energy on enjoying the activity rather than wasting time on choices. For instance, if I plan a day of hiking, I can prepare accordingly, enhancing the overall experience.

While unstructured time can be appealing for relaxation, it may lead to feelings of aimlessness, especially for those with busy schedules. In contrast, a structured approach to free time not only recharges us but also makes our moments off more rewarding. Thus, I advocate for a planned approach to time off for a more fulfilling experience.

#### EX. 3

As for the discussion about grading methods, I strongly aggree that the grades should only reflect their academic performances, despite of how much efforts one put in. As mentioned by Kellly, this involves the issue of fairness. The grade is a confirmation of one's academic achievement, which casts a seriese impacts on students future activities, like applying for a high degree. Thus, giving bonus grades simply for one's extra efforts into the work put other students at disadvantage. For example, I deserve a better score if I outperformances on others, no matter how hard they work. 

One would still argue that the hard work should at least count for something, giving this helps building students characters in the long term. Although I agree hard work should not be neclected, and encourages are necessary for students, this is not throgh raising their academic grades. There are many other ways to demonstrate confirmation of one's hard efforts, but the rule and standards of academic grading should remain intact.

---
(AIGC, 28/30)

In the discussion about grading methods, I strongly agree that grades should reflect academic performance rather than the effort exerted. As Kelly mentioned, this issue relates to fairness. Grades serve as a confirmation of a student’s academic achievements, significantly influencing future opportunities, such as applying to graduate programs. Awarding bonus grades based solely on effort disadvantages those who genuinely excel academically. For instance, if I outperform my peers, I believe I deserve a higher grade, regardless of how hard others have worked.

While some argue that hard work should be recognized to foster character development, I maintain that this recognition should not come through inflated academic grades. Acknowledging effort is important, but there are various ways to do so without compromising the integrity of academic standards. We can encourage students through feedback, awards, or extracurricular recognition, but the criteria for grading should remain consistent and focused on actual performance.

---
(AIGC, 30/30)

In the discussion of grading methods, I firmly believe that grades should reflect academic performance rather than effort. As Kelly pointed out, this issue centers on fairness. Grades are a measure of a student’s academic achievements and play a crucial role in shaping future opportunities, such as admission to graduate programs. Awarding extra points for effort alone unfairly penalizes students who excel academically. For example, if I perform better than my peers, I should receive a higher grade, regardless of the amount of effort others put in.

Although some argue that hard work should be acknowledged to promote character development, I contend that this recognition should not come in the form of inflated grades. Acknowledging effort is important, but it can be done through feedback, awards, or extracurricular recognition, without compromising the integrity of academic standards. Ultimately, the grading system must remain consistent, focusing on actual academic performance rather than effort alone.
