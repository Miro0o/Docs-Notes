DIY 留学攻略指北「共享编辑」
- https://github.com/Ryleeing/GlobalApplication_Co-createdStudyAbroadTutorials
- 这是一份DIY的留学申请的教程，欢迎所有人edit，我有初始备份。也欢迎各个专业的人前来分享。
- 因为我知道这份教程只能现在停止在24fall，未来肯定还会有很多申请变化。希望你在收到我帮之后，也能在你的申请季结束之来参与这份文件的编辑。
- 增加信息的人可以直接写。我认为欧陆申请是完全可以DIY/半DIY的，因为它不复杂。
- 我们不需要中介，我们需要的是勇气。欢迎来到新世界
- it sucks, but you gonna like it.

CS Open Rankings 是结合了 U.S. News, csrankings.org, placement rank, best paper awards 进行的综合排名

> Rankings are an [ideology](https://jeffhuang.com/computer-science-open-data/#bias-in-computer-science-rankings). Each is biased in its own way. So choose and combine existing rankings to generate your preferred meta ranking for computer science programs in the United States and Canada. Ranking sources represent: reputation ([U.S. News](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings)*), faculty publications ([csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org/)*), academic placement ([placement rank](https://drafty.cs.brown.edu/csopenrankings/placement-rank.html)), and recognition ([best paper awards](https://jeffhuang.com/best_paper_awards/)).

## How to Contact Tutors /Make Connections ?
> 🔗 https://www.haojianj.in/prospective.html

Email tips:  
- Please title your email as “Prospective [Ph.D. Student|Visitor|UCSD Student]: YourName - YourAffliation”.
- Briefly introduce what research problem that you are interested in.
- Briefly introduce yourself, including education background, research experiences, and programming skills. Connect your strengths and interests to mine.
- Briefly explain your motivations and expectations of working with me.
- Include your CV and transcript.

Tips for your application (adapted from Henny Admoni's website):  
- Show me you know what research involves. This means describing prior research projects, including how you came up with a novel idea, what you did to solve it, and how you communicated the outcome. The best candidates are ones who are familiar with all phases of the research process, even if they weren’t the ones leading the project themselves. 
- In describing your research, tell me what challenges you faced and how you adapted to those challenges. Research is not a linear process, and I am looking for students who show perseverance and creativity in the face of setbacks. Ph.D. is not easy for anyone. You need to have [Grit](https://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108).
- Give me evidence that you are able to work independently, seek out new avenues for growth, and take responsibility for your learning. Strong candidates show this through activities outside the classroom, for example by doing research internships, joining clubs that allow for hands-on projects, or participating reading groups to discuss current research.
