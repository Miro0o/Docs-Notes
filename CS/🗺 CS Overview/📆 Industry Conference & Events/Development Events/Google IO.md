**Google I/O**, or simply **I/O**, is an annual [developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") [conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeting "Meeting") held by [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") in [Mountain View, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California "Mountain View, California"). The name "I/O" is taken from the number [googol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol "Googol"), with the "I" representing the first digit "1" in a googol and the "O" representing the second digit "0" in the number. The format of the event is similar to [Google Developer Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Developer_Day "Google Developer Day").
