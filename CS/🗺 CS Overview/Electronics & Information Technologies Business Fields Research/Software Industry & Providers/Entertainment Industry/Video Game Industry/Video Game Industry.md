The video game industry is the tertiary and quaternary sectors of the entertainment industry that specialize in the development, marketing, distribution, monetization, and consumer feedback of video games. The industry encompasses dozens of job disciplines and thousands of jobs worldwide.

The video game industry has grown from niche to mainstream. As of July 2018, video games generated US$134.9 billion annually in global sales. In the US, the industry earned about $9.5 billion in 2007, $11.7 billion in 2008, and US$25.1 billion in 2010, according to the ESA annual report. Research from Ampere Analysis indicated three points: the sector has consistently grown since at least 2015 and expanded 26% from 2019 to 2021, to a record $191 billion; the global games and services market is forecast to shrink 1.2% annually to $188 billion in 2022.

The industry has influenced the technological advancement of personal computers through sound cards, graphics cards and 3D graphic accelerators, CPUs, and co-processors like PhysX. Sound cards, for example, were originally developed for games and then improved for adoption by the music industry

According to market research firm Newzoo, the following countries are the largest video game markets by annual revenue, as of 2023:[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry#cite_note-97)

### Value Chain & Industry Roles
**Value Chain**
Traditionally, the video game industry has had six connected layers in its value chain based on the retail distribution of games:
- **Game development**, representing programmers, designers, and artists, and their leadership, with support of middleware and other development tools.
- **Publishing**, which typically includes both the source of funding the development of a video game, as well as providing the marketing and advertising for a game.
- **Distribution**, whether through retail or digital channels. Distribution typically includes manufacturing and duplication of game media and packaging for retail games.
- **Retailer**, storefront where the game is sold.
- **Consumers**, the purchasers and players of video games
- **Hardware platform manufacturers**, which can own and place limitations for content on the platform they have made, charging license fees to developers or publishers.

As games have transitioned from the retail to more digital market, parts of this value chain have become redundant. For example, the distributor may be redundant as a function of either the publisher or the retailer, or even in some cases as the case of indie games, the function of the developer themselves.

**Roles**
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the development side of the industry is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:

- **Capital and publishing layer**: involved in paying for development of new games and seeking returns through licensing of the properties.
- **Product and talent layer**: includes developers, designers and artists, who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
- **Production and tools layer**: generates content production tools, game development middleware, customizable game engines, and production management tools.
- **Distribution layer**: or the "publishing" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
- **Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer**: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as smartphones. This layer includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (such as Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or Facebook.
- **End-users layer**: or the players of the games.

The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: game programmer, game designer, level designer, game producer, game artist, and game tester. Most of these professionals are employed by video game developers or video game publishers. However, many hobbyists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.[citation needed] Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the modding communities
#### Video Game Developer
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer#See_also

A video game developer is a software developer specializing in video game development – the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programmers, designers, artists, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games

#### Video Game Publisher
 > 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher
 
A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that have been developed either internally by the publisher or externally by a video game developer.
##### Types of game publishers
**[AAA game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_\(video_game_industry\))** publishers produce and create games that are high budget and groundbreaking. They are advanced in technology and forward the boundaries of technology and creativity in the video game world. AAA game publishers often produce popular and blockbuster games.

Although they have creative constraints within game development and marketing, they often focus and follow market trends. They have a higher demand to attain commercial success. Examples of AAA video game publishers are Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, and Activision.

**[Indie game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game)** publishers are companies that work with independent developers. Their focus is on developing games that promotes creativity and originality. Developers have creative control over their games. These publishers implement intimate collaborations between the publishers and the developers. Often stand out in the video game market due to the more unique genres. Indie game publishers have restrict marketing budgets and have small audience reach and visibility. Examples of Indie video game publishers are Devolver Digital, Annapurna Interactive and Raw Fury.

**[Mobile game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game "Mobile game")** publishers produce and specialize in video games on smartphones and tablet devices. They take advantage of the widespread appeal and rise of mobile gaming. These publishers enhance games for touch based interfaces and devices. They are proficient in designing monetization tactics for mobile platforms. Mobile game publishers have a comprehensive understanding of the mobile gaming market. They have proficiency in strategies for engagement and user acquisition for mobile sites. For mobile gaming there is access through app stores for distribution channels. There are obstacles with monetization due to lack of in-app purchase and free-to-play(F2P) models. Examples of Mobile game publishers are Supercell, King, and Zynga.
