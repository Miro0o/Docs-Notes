**Computer science is the study of [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information"), [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation"), and [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation "Automation").**  Computer science spans [theoretical disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science "Theoretical computer science") (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to [applied disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_science "Applied science") (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).

<small>Computer System & Computer Science Overview</small>

As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software. [CSAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSAB_(professional_organization) "CSAB (professional organization)"), formerly called **Computing Sciences Accreditation Board** — which is made up of representatives of the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery "Association for Computing Machinery") (ACM), and the [IEEE Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society "IEEE Computer Society") (IEEE CS) — identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: _theory of computation_, _algorithms and data structures_, _programming methodology and languages_, and _computer elements and architecture_. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and [symbolic computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation "Symbolic computation") as being important areas of computer science.

#### ACM CCS
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Computing_Classification_System
> The **ACM Computing Classification System** (**CCS**) is a subject classification system for [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing") devised by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery "Association for Computing Machinery") (ACM). The system is comparable to the [Mathematics Subject Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_Subject_Classification "Mathematics Subject Classification") (MSC) in scope, aims, and structure, being used by the various ACM journals to organize subjects by area.

https://dl.acm.org/ccs
The **2012 ACM Computing Classification System (CCS 2012)** has been developed as a poly-hierarchical ontology that can be utilized in semantic web applications. It replaces the traditional 1998 version of the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS), which has served as the de facto standard classification system for the computing field. It is being integrated into the search capabilities and visual topic displays of the [Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/). It relies on a semantic vocabulary as the single source of categories and concepts that reflect the state of the art of the computing discipline and is receptive to structural change as it evolves in the future. ACM provides 🔍 [a tool within the visual display](https://dl.acm.org/ccs) format to facilitate the application of CCS categories to forthcoming papers and a process to ensure that the CCS stays current and relevant. The CCS visual display has both Interactive and Flat views of the classification tree. You may also opt to download the [CCS SKOS](https://dl.acm.org/pb-assets/dl_ccs/acm_ccs2012-1626988337597.xml) file. The new classification system will play a key role in the development of a people search interface in the ACM Digital Library to supplement its current traditional bibliographic search.
