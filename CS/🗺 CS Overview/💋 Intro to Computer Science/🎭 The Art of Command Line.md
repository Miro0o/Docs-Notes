## Some Excerptions 
### macOS only
These are items relevant *only* on macOS.

- Package management with `brew` (Homebrew) and/or `port` (MacPorts). These can be used to install on macOS many of the above commands.
- Copy output of any command to a desktop app with `pbcopy` and paste input from one with `pbpaste`.
- To enable the Option key in macOS Terminal as an alt key (such as used in the commands above like **alt-b**, **alt-f**, etc.), open Preferences -> Profiles -> Keyboard and select "Use Option as Meta key".
- To open a file with a desktop app, use `open` or `open -a /Applications/Whatever.app`.
- Spotlight: Search files with `mdfind` and list metadata (such as photo EXIF info) with `mdls`.
- Be aware macOS is based on BSD Unix, and many commands (for example `ps`, `ls`, `tail`, `awk`, `sed`) have many subtle variations from Linux, which is largely influenced by System V-style Unix and GNU tools. You can often tell the difference by noting a man page has the heading "BSD General Commands Manual." In some cases GNU versions can be installed, too (such as `gawk` and `gsed` for GNU awk and sed). If writing cross-platform Bash scripts, avoid such commands (for example, consider Python or `perl`) or test carefully.
- To get macOS release information, use `sw_vers`.
