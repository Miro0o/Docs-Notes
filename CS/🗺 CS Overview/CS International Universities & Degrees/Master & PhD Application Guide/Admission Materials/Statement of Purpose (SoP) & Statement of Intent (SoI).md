> ↗ https://cse.umn.edu/cs/ms-admissions

- #### Personal statement/statement of purpose
    Concisely discuss your computer science educational, research, or industrial background as they relate to your objectives. Include any unique experiences relevant to the research you have done. Discuss why you are applying to the University of Minnesota. Please include names of faculty members and research groups at the University of Minnesota whose research is of interest to you. Use this area to list any extenuating circumstances such as poor grades or test scores. (4000 character limit strongly recommended; does not include spaces, not strictly enforced)
- #### Diversity Statements
    This is only required of domestic applicants. A 4000-character limit (not including spaces) is recommended. International applicants do not need to complete this statement, but they are welcome to complete a statement.  
      
    The statement should cover how your background, experiences, and achievements will contribute to the University's and our Department’s goal of promoting excellence through diversity and inclusion. If applicable, you should mention hardships or obstacles you have overcome to complete your undergraduate education. Some University of Minnesota graduate student applicants will be considered for funding opportunities, like the [DOVE Fellowship](https://grad.umn.edu/funding/program-requests-nominations/nominations/diversity-of-views-experience-fellowship-dove), based on their diversity statement.  
      
    Potential areas to address include:
    
    - Hardships you have faced and overcome;
    - Family background;
    - First-generation college student;
    - Non-traditional attributes for computer science/data science;
    - Your lived experience as influenced, informed, or affected by your diverse identities;
    - Your commitment to working toward achieving equity and enhancing diversity within the field of computing, STEM, or within your community;
    - Geographic diversity;
    - Community involvement;
    - Multilingual skills;
    - International travel which changed your perspective;
    - Special talents; and
    - Anything unique you would contribute to the program.
