### My writings
#### I.W.
The reasons why deer keeps their antlers have long been undecided. In the reading it draws out three plausible explanations concerning this phenomenon, while the lecture invalidates of these three propositions. 

First, the reading suggests that the antler of deers servers as a way of heat dissipation. It argues that because antlers contain many blood vessels, having such enormous blood flowing through it can increase the wind's cooling effect and thus maintain deer's temperture at a constant moderate level. The lecture counters this saying that deers grow antler even longer in winter, making the proposition invalid. Also, according to the lecture, in the earth's hotter regions the length of deers' antlers are yet shorter, while in those cooler regions the antler longer.

Second, the reading suggests another speculation that the antler is evolved to be used as a defensive weapon for deers in face of predator. In the reading it mentions examples of bulls and male goats using their horns to fight back attackers. The lecture, on the other hand, denied this. It points out that the female deers, the ones that mostly need such a defensive mechanism because of their parental duties, actually don't possess antlers at all. On the other hand, evidences show that when facing wolves, the common predator of deers, deers seem to kick them, instead of using antlers, to protect themselves. 

Lastly, the reading suggest a third position of antlers that it is actually used for marking male deer's power and masculinity, granting them dominance, as well as deterring other deers. In the lecture the speaker does admit that deers confront each other and one side would retreat when the meet, but she also points out that there is no evidence showing that this is because the size of one's antler outrunning another. There are also examples where deer with bigger antlers passes away in an confrontation, indicating that they are not imposing dominance by their horns. 
#### A.D.
I believe literacy and aesthetic education are equally important to students as practical knowledge.

First, language is the most fundamental ability of human beings, or even a defining trait of human to be what we are. Hence, by learning fiction texts students are actually honing there language skill, improving aesthetic appreciations, which poses a long-lasting, personality shaping effect to them, comparing to the short term benefits brought by learning practical, nonfiction texts. I believe when choosing their pedagogies, it's more reasonable for school to shape students spirits, acting like a bacon lighting their directions, instead of only indoctrinating practical knowledge into them.

Still, some might claim that students learn practical, nonfiction texts from school so that they are more prepared after graduating, in the face of the real world. However, school cannot teach students every skill and knowledge they need in the future. Instead preparing for them with scenario-specific, practical knowledge, teaching the meta knowledge, for instance appreciation of aesthetics by learning literature, seems to be a wiser strategy.
