## Intro



## Writing Exercise
### 1
The statement linking technology negatively with free thinking plays on recent human experience over the past century. Surely there has been no time in history where the lived lives of people have changed more dramatically. A quick reflection on a typical day reveals how technology has revolutionized the world. Most people commute to work in an automobile that runs on an internal combustion engine. During the workday, chances are high that the employee will interact with a computer that operates information on sillicon bridges that are 0.9 microns wide. Upon leaving home, family members will be reached through wireless networks that utilize satellites orbiting the earth. Each f these common occurences could have been inconceivable at the turn of the 19th century.

The statement attempts to bridge these dramatic changes to a reduction in the ability for humans to think for themselves. The assumption is that an increased reliance on technology negates the need for people to think creatively to solve previous quandaries. Looking back at the introduction, one could argue that without a car, computer, or mobile phone, the hypothetical worker would need to find alternate methods of transport, information processing and communication. Technology short circuits this thinking by making the problems obsolete.

Hoever, this reliance on technology does not necessarily preclude the creativity that marks the human species. The prior examples reveal that technology allows for convenience. The car, computer and phone all release additional time for people to live more efficiently. This efficiency does not preclude the need for humans to thinking for themselves. In fact, technology frees humanity to not only tackle new problems, but may itself craete new issues that did not exist without technology. For example, the proliferation of automobiles has introduced a need for fuel conservation on a global scale. With increasing energy demands from emerging markets, global warming becomes a concern inconceivable to the horse-nad-buggy generation. Likewise dependence on oil has created nation-states that are not dependent on taxation, allowing ruling parties to oppress minority groups such as women. Solutions to these complex problems require the unfettered imaginations of maverick scientists and politicians.

In contrast to the statement, we can even see how technology frees the human imagination. Consider how the digital revolution and the advent of the internet has allowed for an unprecedented exchange of ideas. WebMD, a popular internet portal for medical information, permits patients to self research symptoms for a more informed doctor visit. This exercise opens pathways of thinking that were previously closed off to the medical layman. With increased interdisciplinary interactions, inspiration can arrive from the most surprising corners. Jeffery Sachs, one of the architects of the UN Millenium Development Goals, based his ideas on emergency care triage techniques. The unlikely marriage of economics and medicine has healed tense, hyperinflation environments from South America to Easatern Europe.

This last example provides the most hope in hoe technology actually provides hope to the future of humanity. By increasing our reliance on technology, impossible goals can now be achieved. Consider how the late 20th century witnessed complete elimination of smallpox. This disease had ravaged the human race since prehistorical days, and yet iwth the technlogy of vaccines, free thinking humans dared to imagine a world free of smallpox. Using technology, battle plans were drawn out, and smallpox was systematically targeted and eradicated. 

Technology will always mark the human experience, from the discovery of fire to the implementation of nanotechnology. Given the history of the human race, there will be no limit to the number of problems, both new and old, for us to tackle. There is no need to retreat to a Luddite attitude to new things, but rather embrace a hopeful posture to the possibilities that technology provides for new avenues of human imagination.

Claim: Knowing about the past cannot help people to make important decisions today.  
Reason: We are not able to make connections between current events and past events until we have some distance from both.      
Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.

---
I disagree. We can link past to present, hence predict future. 

Admittedly, one can argue that it is hard to know one's position unless one's not in that position. Linking past with present is always hard because the intricate connections tend to hide under sophisticated facile illusions, let alone use that information to envisage future events.

However, from learning past one can still extrapolate the pattern between historical events and conclude regularities, thus immediately apply such meta information as guidances for decisions to future practices without waiting until having some distance from both past and present.  For example, when soccer team coaches make strategies for the upcoming game, they tend to study opposites historical statistics and try to find their weaknesses and preferences from analyzing it. When the players are actually in the game, knowing the styles and preferences of the other side would also greatly helps them to make decisions, like a goal keeper would adjust his position in advance facing a striker because he know the striker likes to shoot from distance.  Or, when encountering a penalty shot goal keeper would know which direction the player is more likely to shoot through previous statistical analysis and thus enhance their save rates. 

Moreover, with a thorough, systematical study of the history human can not only prefigure the future, but also discovery eternal laws that runs the universe, turning empirical knowledge into well-defined serious subjects. By doing this human is able to truly understand the mechanism behind universe, and thus benefits themselves utilizing such knowledges. This has already been proven countless times in history by works of those pioneers in many disciplines. For instance, Economics is an excellent example where people rigorously examined the past data and summarized them into a discipline, making it the guidance for immensely economical activities conducting everyday within every economical entities. Economics reveals some of the fundamental laws of humanities and products exchanges, and it's impossible if economists cannot refer back to historical data and draw economical laws. 

Human beings can always learn from empirical knowledges and turn that into advantages when making decisions towards future. Some times we even come off with serious academic conclusions and developed well-defined subjects based on them. There is no need to treat history as futile since, historically, we have proofed it over and over again that history really is our previous knowledge facing the wild, unknown nature.

The speaker asserts that since it is difficult to find out the connections between the current issues and the past ones until they both become part of the history, knowing about the past cannot help us to make important decisions today. I agree with his assertion insofar. After all, the history cannot always manage to serve as foolproof panaceas to all current issues. However, I must point out that we still can learn lessons from the history about what we cannot and should not do.  

As the progress of our society, the societal problems develop themselves as well. When we witness the huge improvement we have achieved today, we also find that the issues and challenges we face today are more complicated and fresh than the past ones. As a result, when dealing with the problems today, we may find it difficult to find some issues of the past close enough for a good reference. Take the problems of violence and crime as an example. Crimes and evil things almost trouble any single society. Therefore, I suppose our predecessors should have developed fully system and methods to deal with and stop the sins from happening, and surely they did: the laws, the reforms, the “tough-on-crime” approach and so forth. But now the crimes and sins are still here to stay, and become so complicated----with complex motives, sophisticated plots, novel methods and etc----that it is hard for us to define or handle them only with the aid of the experience from our predecessors. Everything changes, and we are driven to develop new methods for the new problems as well instead of referring to the vague historical issues.  
  
However, the history does teach us some lessons about failures for us to refer in case we get trapped in the same trench. For example, the history of the 1st and 2nd wars reminds us of the huge damages caused by wars. We still can recall the long-lasting regression of the postwar period and the pains people suffered both mentally and physically. We can even image our extinction if we apply nuclear weapons again. Therefore, we human beings today become aware of the huge disadvantages of the wars and reach an agreement about against-war policy. We witness that nations try to develop amicable relations with each other today to pursue the prosperity for all in spite of the continuous conflicts and biases between countries.   

Moreover, from the history, we also can prove the theories and get an answer for their availability. For example, the utopian socialism was once popular in western society in the early 20th century. Some people believed it could create a better society which would one day replace the current one. One of these people is Robert Owen, who purchased a land in the center of America serving as a community experiment for a practice of the utopian dreams. The result of this experiment, however, was a failure. People in a society of public ownership never become rich since they suppose their work is not for themselves, and even they do not work, they still can enjoy the fruits of other people----so no one works. In this light the history proves the futility of this utopian dream and we can also learn this lesson from the break-down of the Former Soviet Union.   

In sum, when making decisions we may feel it difficult to target some relative historical issues for a reference to the current ones since today’s social problems are as old as the society itself and therefore become so complicated and fresh for us. However, I agree that studying the past is of some value, for example, it can help learn we should not start warfare and prove the futility of the utopian socialism.

**Governments Should Place Few, If Any, Restrictions on Scientific Research and Development**

Scientific research is vital for progress, but without proper oversight, it can lead to ethical, safety, and environmental concerns. While innovation should be encouraged, governments must impose reasonable restrictions to ensure responsible and safe advancements.

Unregulated research risks crossing ethical boundaries, particularly in areas like human experimentation and genetic engineering. Technologies like CRISPR, without ethical guidelines, could lead to harmful consequences, such as human cloning or designer babies. Historical examples, such as Nazi human experimentation during World War II, underscore the dangers of unchecked scientific practices.

Moreover, public safety must be protected. The thalidomide tragedy in the 1960s, where a drug caused severe birth defects, is a clear example of why government oversight is necessary in medical research. Similarly, nuclear energy research, if left unregulated, could result in catastrophic accidents like Chernobyl or Fukushima, threatening entire populations.

Environmental protection is another critical area. Unregulated research into fossil fuels has contributed to climate change, and the use of pesticides like DDT led to ecological damage before it was banned. These examples show that scientific progress must be balanced with environmental responsibility.

However, in some cases, fewer restrictions can be beneficial. During the COVID-19 pandemic, fast-tracked vaccine approvals helped save millions of lives. In emergencies, more flexible regulations can expedite critical innovations.

In conclusion, while scientific research should not be overly restricted, governments play a vital role in ensuring that ethical, safety, and environmental standards are upheld. A balanced approach allows innovation to thrive while protecting society from potential harm.

**Governments Should Place Few, If Any, Restrictions on Scientific Research and Development**

Scientific research and development (R&D) are vital for the advancement of society, leading to breakthroughs in medicine, technology, and countless other fields. However, the recommendation that governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research is problematic. While unrestricted R&D may accelerate innovation, it can also result in ethical violations, safety hazards, and environmental degradation. Thus, I argue that governments should impose appropriate restrictions to ensure that scientific advancements are made responsibly and ethically. In this essay, I will explore how unchecked research can lead to harm, while also acknowledging the need for a balanced approach to regulation.


**Ethical Implications of Unrestricted Research**

Unrestricted scientific research can lead to serious ethical violations, particularly in areas such as human experimentation and genetic engineering. When research is conducted without ethical oversight, the risk of crossing moral boundaries becomes dangerously high. For instance, genetic engineering technologies like CRISPR have opened new doors for editing human DNA, including the possibility of human cloning or creating so-called “designer babies.” Without clear ethical guidelines and government oversight, scientists could use these technologies in ways that undermine the intrinsic value of human life, commodifying people based on genetic traits.

History provides grim examples of the dangers of unregulated scientific practices. During World War II, Nazi doctors conducted horrifying experiments on concentration camp prisoners, claiming they were advancing medical science. These experiments, which caused untold suffering, were conducted without any ethical oversight. This tragic history underscores the importance of governmental restrictions to prevent scientific research from violating human rights and moral principles.


**Public Safety and Health Risks**

In addition to ethical concerns, unrestricted scientific research can pose significant risks to public safety and health. Government restrictions are crucial to ensure that innovations in fields such as biotechnology and medicine do not endanger people’s lives. The history of drug development provides clear examples of why government oversight is necessary. In the 1950s and 1960s, the drug thalidomide was marketed as a safe treatment for morning sickness in pregnant women, but it had devastating side effects, resulting in thousands of birth defects. This tragedy could have been avoided if stronger regulations and safety protocols had been in place before the drug was made widely available.

Another area where unrestricted research poses a danger to public safety is nuclear energy. While nuclear power holds promise as a cleaner energy source, the risks associated with it are immense if not carefully regulated. The Chernobyl disaster of 1986 and the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in 2011 highlight the catastrophic consequences of inadequate regulation in the nuclear industry. Without government oversight, research and development in nuclear energy could lead to further accidents that threaten entire populations and ecosystems.


**Environmental Concerns**

Government restrictions are also necessary to protect the environment from the potential harm caused by unchecked scientific research. Technological advancements in energy production, agriculture, and industry can have long-lasting impacts on the environment, and without regulations, the pursuit of profit or progress may take precedence over environmental sustainability. For instance, research and development in the fossil fuel industry, driven by the goal of maximizing energy production, has contributed significantly to climate change and environmental degradation.

The use of chemical pesticides in agriculture provides another example of how scientific research can have unintended environmental consequences. The pesticide DDT, once hailed as a revolutionary tool for pest control, was later found to be harmful to wildlife, particularly birds, and was eventually banned in many countries due to its environmental impact. If the government had not intervened, the widespread use of DDT could have led to even more severe ecological damage, illustrating the need for regulatory oversight to balance innovation with environmental responsibility.


**Circumstances Where Restrictions Are Harmful**

While government restrictions on scientific research are necessary in many cases, overly restrictive policies can slow down critical innovations. In certain situations, such as during public health emergencies, more flexibility in research regulations may be needed. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of mRNA vaccines was accelerated through fast-tracked approval processes that temporarily reduced regulatory barriers. This allowed scientists to develop life-saving vaccines in record time, demonstrating that in times of crisis, less restrictive approaches to research can be beneficial.

However, even in such cases, some level of oversight is still necessary to ensure that new technologies are safe and effective. The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines was accompanied by rigorous clinical trials and safety evaluations, showing that a balance between speed and safety is possible. This example highlights that while governments should allow for flexibility in certain circumstances, they must maintain a degree of control to protect public health and safety.


**The Role of Government as a Regulator**

The ideal role of the government in scientific research is to act as a mediator, ensuring safety and ethical standards while promoting innovation. A successful example of this balance can be seen in the regulatory frameworks implemented in biomedical research, such as Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) that oversee human experimentation. These boards ensure that research involving human subjects adheres to ethical standards while still allowing for scientific progress. Similarly, regulatory agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) play a crucial role in ensuring that new drugs and medical treatments are both safe and effective before they reach the public.

By setting clear guidelines and regulations, governments can encourage responsible research that benefits society without hindering innovation. Rather than stifling scientific progress, these regulations create a framework in which science can thrive safely and ethically. Government oversight fosters public trust in science, ensuring that research serves the public good and not just the interests of private corporations or individual scientists.


**Conclusion**

While scientific research is essential for societal progress, it must be conducted responsibly, with due consideration for ethical, safety, and environmental concerns. Unrestricted research can lead to ethical violations, endanger public health, and cause environmental harm, making government oversight necessary. However, in certain circumstances, such as during public health crises, a less restrictive approach may be beneficial. Ultimately, the government’s role should be to regulate research in a way that promotes innovation while safeguarding the well-being of society and the environment. A balanced approach ensures that scientific advancements can continue to benefit humanity without causing unintended harm.
