自己的project比较杂，有neural style transfer，object detection这种然后做成前段网页这种。

推荐信也不咋滴都是任课prof，估计一篇会偏强推一点，剩下两篇应该就一般推，只能夸一下上的课成绩那种。

All EIT Digital Master School programmes follow the same scheme:
- Students study one year at an ‘entry’ university and one year at an ‘exit’ university.
- The first year is similar at all entry points, with a focus on basic courses that lay the foundation for the chosen technical programme. Students are introduced to business and management during this first year. During the second semester, a design project is combined with business development exercises to demonstrate how technology can be transformed into a successful business with optional elective courses. Students are taught how to prepare and present a convincing business plan. 
- In between the first year and the second year, students participate in the EIT Digital 2 week Summer School programme that addresses business opportunities within a socially relevant theme.
- The second year offers a specialisation and a graduation project. The graduation project includes an internship at a company or a research institute and cumulates with a Master thesis having a strong innovation and entrepreneurship dimension.
- Graduates receive degrees from the two universities and a certificate awarded by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.

[在荷兰留学是怎么样的体验？ - 德国Viviane的回答 - 知乎]: https://www.zhihu.com/question/28504528/answer/3234657391

“玛丽居里”行动（Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions）是[欧盟框架计划](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E6%AC%A7%E7%9B%9F%E6%A1%86%E6%9E%B6%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A3120977729%7D)在科研人才培养方面发起的旨在增强欧盟科研人员竞争力的计划。行动命名源于两次诺贝尔奖获得者波兰-法国科学家“居里夫人”。该行动支持的研究学者包括各个研究领域，而且涵盖到所有国籍，包括学术界和企业界，从科研到培训。  
玛丽居里项目针对不同的目标共有5种类型：

**01 DN- Doctoral Network**  
Doctoral Networks 的目标是通过来自欧洲及其他地区不同部门的组织的合作伙伴关系实施博士课程，以培养高技能的博士候选人，激发他们的创造力，提高他们的创新能力，并提高他们的长期就业能力。  

**02 PF- Postdoctoral Fellowships**  
PF的目标是支持研究人员的职业生涯并培养卓越的研究。博士后奖学金行动的目标是拥有博士学位的研究人员，他们将在国外开展研究活动，获得新技能并发展自己的职业生涯。PF 帮助研究人员在其他国家、学科和非学术部门获得经验。  

**03 SE-Staff Exchanges**  
SE 行动支持参与组织的研究和创新活动的工作人员的短期国际和跨部门交流。目的是在欧洲及其他地区的学术和非学术部门（特别是中小企业）的不同组织之间开展可持续的合作项目。交换的员工可以获得新的知识、技能和职业发展前景，同时参与组织也可以提高了他们的研究和创新能力。  
SE项目向大学、研究机构、企业、中小企业和其他非学术组织开放。  

**04 COFUND**

[在荷兰留学是怎么样的体验？ - 德国Viviane的回答 - 知乎]: https://www.zhihu.com/question/28504528/answer/3234657391

德国的留学制度确实值得黑，关于德国留学的一些吐槽....  

- **留学时间长：** 德语一般要学两年，很少见到能解决这个问题的，硕士申请，会经常有本科的补课，以及实习或者项目要求，也就意味着很难正常时间毕业
- **存在种族歧视** ：无论是学校还是工作，总会有人轻视你德语不好，占你便宜（比如恶房东和办事人员），在职场中，有女性朋友拿错了报告，结果被一白男同事当着众人面，被骂亚洲蠢货，中国垃圾，当时她德语不好不敢反击，只能自己哭泣（建议千万不要这样！！会助长恶人气焰，种族歧视在职场中，非常严重，请立刻保留证据，拉上证人证词，投诉到工会和HR，德国公司是有权保护你的权益，严重时，甚至是必须开除种族歧视者，如果没有，你是可以起诉公司巨额赔偿的）
- **德国医疗系统**：贵，全，慢，其实德国医疗系统真的很慢，虽然全报销，但真的贵，而且公保看病，约到的termin特别差。但在德国，公保是必须买的，就是公民的义务Pflicht.....
- **税收高：** 如果你没家庭没孩子，恭喜你，每个月接近一半的收入都要上交给政府！！

除了留学便宜，好移民，工作足够躺平，没有内卷和内耗，**其它方面没有优势，有钱建议去美国**。讲优势的话，如下：  
- 德国公立大学大多**免学费**：比起英美，确实是白菜价...
- **学生福利确实不错**：我大学报的高尔夫课和骑马课才30欧一学期...球场特别大...还有去法国的冲浪课，滑翔课都很便宜..
- **相比英美，很容易找工作和留欧**...如果你语言没问题，就能找到工作，前提也是语言没问题（德语真的难...所以工作好找，语言关不好过）
- 德国在欧洲的**工资水平相对较高**（远远高于比利时意大利西班牙，算上生活成本次高于英国与法国，至于和美国和瑞士比的话，那确实比不了，但没法，美国是学费贵留不下来，瑞士是生活贵留不下来）
- 确实**不卷**，万分**躺平**，绝对不会出现加班到八点的情况，工会十分十分强大，全公司没人希望你加班，你加班了，你老板还会找你谈话，让你别加班
- **社会福利确实不错**：我得吐槽下，这个社会福利是建立在高税收的情况下，但社会福利确实很好，你失业了有失业金和再培训（上万欧的培训费，德国就业处会替你出，之前有朋友没找到工作，找就业处报了SAP培训课12000多欧，快10w的培训费，是就业处帮忙出的...确实很不错）

-德国大学通常不设奖学金，主要由DAAD等组织和各类基金会提供。DAAD 面向中国学生提供的奖学金项目可以在 DAAD 中国官网查询及下载：[http://www.daad.org.cn](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.daad.org.cn/)（请点击“奖学金信息”）。根据项目不同，申请截止时间和申请材料均有所区别，按照项目规定提交申请即可。有关 DAAD 奖学金的申请问题可以发邮件至 scholarship@daad.org.cn 询问。除此之外，DAAD 还建立了一个奖学金数据库用于搜索德国其他的奖学金项目，其网址为：[http://www.funding-guide.de](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.funding-guide.de/)。

[在荷兰留学是怎么样的体验？ - 德国Viviane的回答 - 知乎]: https://www.zhihu.com/question/28504528/answer/3234657391

荷兰留学H类和U类大学有什么区别？
荷兰的大学体系中确实存在两种主要类型的大学，分别是U类大学（Universiteit）和H类大学（Hogeschool）。以下是它们之间的主要区别，涉及到申请和国际认可度：
1. **U类大学（Universiteit）** 
	1. **学术研究为主** U类大学侧重于提供学术研究和理论导向的课程，包括学士、硕士和博士学位
	2. **科学研究** 这些大学通常有强大的科学研究基础，涵盖多个学科领域。
	3. **学术学位** U类大学颁发的学位更倾向于学术性，适用于追求深入研究和学术职业的学生。
2. **H类大学（Hogeschool）**
	1. **职业教育** H类大学主要提供职业教育，强调实践和应用技能的培养。
	2. **应用科学** 课程更加注重应用科学，旨在使学生具备直接应用于职场的实用技能。
	3. **专业学位** H类大学颁发的学位通常是与特定职业领域相关的专业学位，如工程师、护士等。
3. **申请**
	1. **U类大学** 申请U类大学通常需要更强调学术背景、研究兴趣和学术成就。需要提交推荐信、个人陈述以及可能的学术考试成绩（如IELTS或TOEFL）。
	2. **H类大学** 申请H类大学更注重实际经验和职业目标。可能需要工作经验、实习经历，以及与所选专业相关的实际技能。

4. **国际认可度**
	1. **U类大学** 由于其强调学术研究，U类大学的学位在国际上通常更受认可，特别是对于追求学术研究职业或进入全球性公司的学生。
	2. **H类大学** H类大学的学位在荷兰国内具有很高的声望，但在国际上可能相对较少被认可。然而，这并不意味着其学位毫无价值，特别是对于那些寻求职业培训和实际技能的学生。

	- **A concise description of courses from your previous degree(s)**
		- N.B. this is not your academic transcript, but a description of the courses in your degree program. Usually this entails your Bachelor's degree, but if you are taking or have completed a further degree course, please also provide a description of these courses, if relevant to your application. The description should be concise, but must have sufficient detail to determine whether the combined subject matter of your courses demonstrates eligibility for the Master program. It typically lists 5 to 10 topics or learning objectives treated in each course or subject. You do not have to include all courses or subjects, only the ones which are relevant to evaluate eligibility.
	- **Résumé / curriculum vitae**
	- **Motivation letter**
	- **A summary of your dissertation (in English)**  
		- This is a summary of the dissertation or thesis you wrote to complete your academic education. It may also be a description of a final year project. If you have completed a Master’s program it may be your thesis. If you have not (yet) written such a document, please upload a short explanation, explaining either that you have not yet completed your dissertation, thesis or final project, or that your university does not require a dissertation, thesis or final project for graduation. This document should be in the English language.
	- **Proof of financial means (applies to students with non-EEA nationality).**
		- The proof of financial means is a statement from your bank showing you have access to a minimum amount for living expenses. The IND (Dutch immigration service) settles this amount every year in December for the upcoming academic year. For academic year 2024-2015 it was settled at a (equivalent to) €14,700. Because we expect this amount to rise, we ask you now to upload a proof showing you have access to a minimum amount of (equivalent to) €18,000,-. The bank statement may not be older than 3 months.

🚪 https://www.universityadmissions.se/intl/login

To increase your chances of getting admitted to KTH, we advise you to select more than one programme when applying. You can apply for up to four programmes and rank them in your order of preference.

---
**Selection Procedure /Criteria**
The selection process is based on the following criteria: Study results (grades, relevant subjects and English), motivation for studies (motivation letter, references, courses and relevant work experience) and prior education.

Prior education is evaluated based on the quality and suitability of the subjects that are relevant for the programme applied for. Prior education is evaluated based on the Swedish Higher Education Authority´s standards for Swedish higher education institutions. For international higher education institutions, university rankings are used. The merit rating is carried out on a scale of 1-75.

**Supporting Documents**
https://www.universityadmissions.se/en/apply-to-masters/provide-application-documents-masters/country-instructions/china-mainland/
- **The letter of motivation** explains why you have chosen this programme at KTH, what you hope to gain from it and how your interests and skills will help you succeed in your studies. Include an autobiography with the development and relevance of your academic and professional pursuits, extra-curricular activities and related experiences. KTH does not require a standard template, but it must be in English and less than 500 words. If you apply to multiple programmes that require a letter of motivation, you should submit one for each and state which programme each letter applies to at the top of the page.
- **Two letters of recommendation** describing why you are the right choice for admission. Preferably, have one referee from an academic environment and one from a professional setting. If you apply for multiple programmes at KTH that request letters of recommendation, you may use the same letters for several programmes. You must provide an English translation if the letters are in a different language. The letters must have the referees' full contact details. If your referee wants to submit the letter themselves, they must send it by post to [University Admissions](https://bit.ly/2NQFQuV) and state your name and application number. They can not submit the letter via email.

> 首先你必须找老师做科研，这样一方面丰富cv和sop，另一方面有一封推荐信，其实，我个人认为同时找两个老师做也不是不可以，当然需要看时间和经历。其次gpa也很重要，大部分科研好的人，gpa都不差，所以除非你在某一方向极其突出，否则gpa也要搞好

> 感觉评论里都说很容易，但是我目前美硕申请phd的感觉压力很大ಥ_ಥ可能是我太菜了 
> 找了俩老师做research+master gpa 4.0/4.0+要到了三封这边推荐信 ..
> 主要问题是论文被拒了，但是我套瓷下来还不错的program老师对master的期待就是要有1-2篇以上论文（顶会一作）但我觉得美硕真的时间紧张
> 总之我觉得很难，ಥ_ಥ不知道有没有大佬能提点目前的建议

> 求推荐转博良好的学校～
> 一般私立学校还有导师制（弱committee）都很好转

> 你太不了解Phd录取了 大多数老师都倾向于招跟自己干过的学生 因为不仅省事 不用去翻申请找学生 而且也相对更了解 所以他显然是想要招你的 尤其还用你的项目申了funding 直接让你上手最合适 然而他想招人必须要过了研究生院和你们系的committee这两关 不是说他想捞就捞的 他可以推荐你给committee但是如果你真的不能让commiittee满意 他还真的是一点办法都没有 至于fellowship 能争取干嘛不多争取 剩下来的钱又可以多找一个人 楼主你不要想太多 不过话又说回来了 申Phd不能押宝在一家上 你既然要申 虽然是同校 但是肯定也走了流程的 好歹多申几家啊

> uva我其实也不是很了解，但我看中的就是tamu的性价比，相较于之前大家认为的tamu肯定没那么好，但是相较于uva还是要好不少。而且我感觉opencs上的写的有点主观了😂（，哪个学校都是那样，只能说tamu是其中之一，大环境不好啥学校也没办法（除了顶尖的）
> 同求组织，我也录到了UVA和这个，比较纠结，看opencs说TAMU现在地理位置没啥优点了，大厂也不愿意给面试，UVA那边介绍不太多，但是我听同学说UVA是google和amazon的target school。请问楼主怎么看
> 我倾向于tamu，首先花费tamu比uva要低不少，再加上这个比uva要灵活一年，而且我不太在意气候环境因素，title上两个学校大差不差，基本都是在找工作中没什么太大加成的，所以感觉tamu是更优选

> 应该不会去，尤其考虑到opencs上说这个项目性价比也在变低，虽然感觉b+/a-这一档的项目能看上我就不错了T T
> 再等等彩票和其它主申呗，因为我倾向回国所以相比找工更在乎title和排名一点qwq目前的ad里非要选一个可能就cmu msmite或者tandon mscs（？）

https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/ms-computer-and-information-technology

[Admissions Requirements](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/ms-computer-and-information-technology/admissions)
The admissions process selects highly qualified applicants into the MS program by considering each of the following criteria in judging the overall strength of the applicant. Typically, no single criterion is used as a sole determinant for admission.

- A relevant, earned baccalaureate degree in computer science, information technology, computer engineering, information systems, informatics, or other computer-related field of study. Minimally, students should have earned 15-18 credit hours of computational coursework. Students with insufficient academic preparation, in the faculty’s judgment, may be conditionally admitted but required to develop additional computing competencies by enrolling in designated undergraduate courses prior to undertaking their graduate study.
- An undergraduate grade point average of 3.00 or better (on a 4.00 scale) from accredited institutions is required for unconditional admission.
- Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores at or above the 50th percentile (for each test subsection) are required for unconditional admission. There is no minimum score expectation. The GRE is not waived for admission to this program.
- Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required for international applicants whose first language is not English and who have not graduated from a university or college using English as the language of instruction. The following minimum scores are required for the Internet-based TOEFL:  Overall 90, Reading 20, Listening 20, Speaking 20, and Writing 20. For the paper-based TOEFL, the minimum score is 600.
- Demonstration of a high level of competence in written communication as evidenced by a writing sample such as the statement of purpose, a prior thesis, a research paper, or other significant and personally written product.
- Personal and professional characteristics commensurate with success in the computer and information technology profession.

Note: the faculty evaluators may also require a personal interview, usually by phone.

[4th AD MSCS@Gatech]: https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1060772-1-1.html
一个很让人纠结的项目，上个月在这个项目和 ucsd 之间比较了很久，详细地列了各自的优缺点
最后还是觉得 gatech 一学期四个课太累，ucsd 生活质量高，而且想做的 mlsys 方向 ucsd 确实更强一点，所以也不后悔拒掉 gatech 啦～
个人留美意愿没那么强烈，完全接受回国工作，所以 gatech 最具优势的 coop 对我也没那么重要啦

**Difference between Tandon and Courant?**
https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-377234-2-1.html (2018)
> courant 毕业要修满36个学分，tandon 毕业要修满30个学分。两个cs在不同的学院，上课校区不一样，选课不一样，教授应该也是不一样的。貌似courant可以选tandon的但是tandon不能选courant的课，但是两个cs都可以选其他学院，例如ds或者math的课。不过tandon在布鲁克林，如果上其他学院的课就需要到曼岛，略麻烦了。因为两个校区，所以两个学院的学生基本上没有什么交集。career fair倒是每年都在tandon那边开。招人这个bar很玄学，感觉courant对转专业的优秀生非常友好，tandon好像更喜欢科班出身。然后courant招人比tandon少很多。个人感觉，这两个cs很独立了，并没有看到要合并的倾向。

> 再补充下其他人的内容
> 
> 课程设置上，courant非常偏理论，基本没什么可以写project然后放简历上的课；tandon据说要好一些？会有web之类比较实用的课
> courant的教授什么还是要强一些的，但差别也不大就是 courant和tandon应该不会合并，毕竟是两个完全不同的校区，而且两个学院也分别招了不少教授。 虽说tandon这两年形势见好bar不停上涨，可是tandon的bar比courant高？这还是过分了吧。毕竟分开排名的时候，courant在30左右，tandon是70.
> 
> 找工各方面不会被差别对待的，反正大家简历上都写的NYU，即使写了学院，大部分recruiter不知道，知道了也不会在乎courant和tandon之间的区别。
> 虽然现在在courant，但确实没有感受到courant相较于tandon的有什么明显的优势。。可能周围有很强的大佬算一点？学费还贵不少。。。emmmm 只能用bar高来安慰自己了

> 忙里偷闲写了个体验。我也不想它单纯地被解读为吐槽贴。因为这个项目还是有很多优点。比如较为轻松的安排， ML方面的资源。 毕业即可申请进枫叶卡pool。中国同学拿到这个项目的offer也是一件不容易的事，是对你学术和工作能力的肯定。但是希望有其他offer的同学，慎重考虑。尤其是有美国和瑞士offer的同学。调整好对教学的心理预期。 调整好对工资，大厂和实习配对的心理预期。总体上，我觉得项目的faculty也是在苦心经营。然而多大研究生CS教学的局限，加拿大的整体就业环境，和隔壁uw的竞争，带来一些预期上的天花板。个人建议想来的话，可以先自己补点CV和NLP,  做点小project, 用处会比刷题大。
> 
> 有美国CS前八，瑞士两个理工MSCS offer和多大MSCS的大佬，就不要考虑了吧。MSCS开学就有supervisor带着一起做research，对个人学术和职业发展的帮助肯定会大于这个项目的实习。

BG：陆本计算机较强211，科班（非计算机科学与技术专业）；
成绩：专业rk1， overall GPA3.87（学校官方，未使用其他证明或换算），百分制93.6；
语言：雅思8（7）；
GRE：156+170+3.5；
推荐信：两校内老师，一科研加导（从结果看应该为强推，但是因为科研本身较水，导和项目也不强，所以推荐信可能作用不大）
软背景：一段科研一段实习，均为三个月，都比较水（但是简历和面试问起要有的说）其中科研为Mitacs，在加拿大蒙特利尔开展；实习为线上.1point3acres
就个人所知，有至少3位22/23去了此项目的学长学姐，1人同专业，3人同学院

12.12面试/
12.18发邮件询问进度/
12.19回复大概率可以在寒假前更新我的申请结果/
12.21凌晨（多大寒假前最后一天的下午）收到邮件，进入项目官网查看录取结果. check 1point3acres for more.

面经：
为Claire的非技术面试。持续约42分钟。
Claire的语速非常快，并且不是像雅思考官一样会一板一眼、清晰地直接地问问题，所以要把问题的落脚点听仔细（通常是最后几个单词），并且回答问题要灵活一些，充分利用上准备的内容中和问题相关的部分。. ----
流程上，Claire首先会简单自我介绍，而后会介绍面试的目的。接着就是你的第一个问题：tell about yourself
比起往年面经，个人感觉会更重视你本人的成长经历和意愿。具体来讲：
①前两个问题问的是为什么选择此专业和此本科学校，这不是我准备的重点，所以上来非常慌乱，举人名例子甚至举了埃隆马斯克（多大出身的人工智能泰斗Hinton，及其学生OpenAI首席科学家Ilya都是很好的例子，以及矢量研究院的大佬或是其他不太出圈的技术专家都更好）。从结果来看，这可能反而显得我没有“刻意准备”，或是被认为并不是致命问题。
②看起来很关心我在简历上写的经历。我的科研和实习两段经历都被详细问了，还有追问（此处可以适当引导，比如说我认为选择xx可以让我怎么怎么样，她就会就这个“怎么怎么样”再追问下去）。

其他问题包括：
①why MScAC?（并没有问why abroad/Canada/Toronto，我当时也是脑子木了，没有说这些，当然切题是最重要的，如果你在这里洋洋洒洒说很多，准备的痕迹就比较重了；这些问题可以穿插在你的其他回答中，例如我在回答关于我的加拿大科研的问题时，提及了上述内容）.1point3acres
②有没有internship时想去的公司？
③因为楼主在addtional information提交了简单的课程兴趣，所以Claire问除了我提及的几门课，还有没有其他想上的课. 1point 3 acres
④没有问我认为肯定会问的：如果有了offer A再来offer B怎么办/某门课为什么分数低/本科学习中印象深刻的事（而是将重心放在你简历中提及的经历，看看你是不是真的在认真做）

到这里Claire的问题就结束了，时间只有30分钟出头。我努力撑时长问了5个问题，平均每个问题回答约2分钟。

还没有拿到面试邀请邮件的伙伴请不要慌，楼主个人认为拿到的早有几个原因，大家可以对照着看看：
①submit和完成所有申请步骤的时间都较早，在10月份结束之前
②有GRE（GRE在此项目中是比较重要的补充材料）
③比较有力的BG，主要是GPA（或许和②可以归结为一点），以及有同本科学校专业的在读学长

多大寒假放到1月8日，在那之前都不会上班；比我晚提交的同学可能还没入池，就更不要着急啦，可以适当练习英语口语……地里的面经总结是很完善的，可结合我的个人体验食用。

最后，感谢大家看到这里，祝大家都能去自己想去的地方~
