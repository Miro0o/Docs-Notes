## 🛐 Modern Math Structure

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a **structure** is a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)) endowed with some additional features on the set (e.g. an [operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)), [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics)), [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)), or [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space)). Often, the additional features are attached or related to the set, so as to provide it with some additional meaning or significance.

A partial list of possible structures are:
- [measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory)
- [algebraic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure) ([groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)), [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)), etc.)
- [topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
- [metric structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space) ([geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry))
- [orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory)
- [events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_structure)
- [equivalence relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation)
- [differential structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_structure)
- [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics)).

Sometimes, a set is endowed with more than one feature simultaneously, which allows mathematicians to study the interaction between the different structures more richly. For example, an ordering imposes a rigid form, shape, or topology on the set, and if a set has both a topology feature and a group feature, such that these two features are related in a certain way, then the structure becomes a [topological group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_group).

[Mappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics)) between sets which preserve structures (i.e., structures in the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function) are mapped to equivalent structures in the [codomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codomain)) are of special interest in many fields of mathematics. Examples are [homomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism), which preserve algebraic structures; [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism), which preserve topological structures; and [diffeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism), which preserve differential structures.

## Theoretical Computer Science (TCS)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science

**Theoretical computer science** (**TCS**) is a subset of general [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") that focuses on mathematical aspects of [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") such as the [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation "Theory of computation"), [formal language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language_theory "Formal language theory"), the [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus "Lambda calculus") and [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory "Type theory").

It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The [ACM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery "Association for Computing Machinery")'s [Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_SIGACT "ACM SIGACT")(SIGACT) provides the following description:

> TCS covers a wide variety of topics including [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms "Algorithms"), [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure"), [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory"), [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computation "Parallel computation") and [distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computation "Distributed computation") computation, [probabilistic computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_computation "Probabilistic computation"), [quantum computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computation "Quantum computation"), [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory "Automata theory"), [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory"), [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"), [program semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_semantics "Program semantics") and [verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods "Formal methods"), [algorithmic game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_game_theory "Algorithmic game theory"), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"), [computational biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology "Computational biology"), [computational economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_economics "Computational economics"), [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry "Computational geometry"), and [computational number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_number_theory "Computational number theory") and [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation "Symbolic computation"). Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and [rigor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigor#Mathematical_rigour "Rigor").
