InÂ [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science "Theoretical computer science")Â andÂ [formal language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language_theory "Formal language theory"), aÂ **regular language**(also called aÂ **rational language**)Â is aÂ [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language")Â that can be defined by aÂ [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression"), in the strict sense in theoretical computer science (==as opposed to many modern regular expression engines, which areÂ augmented with featuresÂ that allow the recognition of non-regular languages==).

Alternatively, a regular language can be defined as a language recognized by aÂ [finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_automaton "Finite automaton"). The equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata is known asÂ **Kleene's theorem** (after American mathematicianÂ [Stephen Cole Kleene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene "Stephen Cole Kleene")). In theÂ [Chomsky hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy "Chomsky hierarchy"), regular languages are the languages generated byÂ [Type-3 grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grammar "Regular grammar").
