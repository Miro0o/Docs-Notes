**Computability theory**, also known asÂ **recursion theory**, is a branch ofÂ [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"),Â [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and theÂ [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation "Theory of computation")Â that originated in the 1930s with the study ofÂ [computable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function "Computable function")Â andÂ [Turing degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_degree "Turing degree"). The field has since expanded to include the study of generalizedÂ [computability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability "Computability")Â andÂ [definability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definable_set "Definable set"). In these areas, computability theory overlaps withÂ [proof theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory "Proof theory")Â andÂ [effective descriptive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_descriptive_set_theory "Effective descriptive set theory").

Basic questions addressed by computability theory include:

-   What does it mean for aÂ [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")Â on theÂ [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number")Â to be computable?
-   How can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?

Although there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematical computability theorists study the theory of relative computability, reducibility notions, and degree structures; those in the computer science field focus on the theory ofÂ [subrecursive hierarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory"),Â [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_method "Formal method"), andÂ [formal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language").
