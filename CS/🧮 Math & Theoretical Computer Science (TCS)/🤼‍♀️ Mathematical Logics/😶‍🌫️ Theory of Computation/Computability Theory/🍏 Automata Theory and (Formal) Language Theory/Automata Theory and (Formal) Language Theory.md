### Formal Language Theory
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language

In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), a **formal language** consists of [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word "Word") whose [letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(formal) "Symbol (formal)") are taken from an [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_(formal_languages) "Alphabet (formal languages)") and are [well-formed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formedness "Well-formedness") according to a specific set of rules.
- The alphabet of a formal language consists of symbols, letters, or [tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type%E2%80%93token_distinction "Type–token distinction") that concatenate into [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)") of the language. 
	- Each string concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a word, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called _well-formed words_ or _[well-formed formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula "Well-formed formula")_. 
- A formal language is often defined by means of a [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar "Formal grammar") such as a [regular grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grammar "Regular grammar") or [context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar "Context-free grammar"), which consists of its [formation rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_rule "Formation rule").
#### Formal Language & Other Subjects
- In computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with meanings or [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics "Semantics"). 

- In [computational complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory"), [decision problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem "Decision problem") are typically defined as formal languages, and [complexity classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_class "Complexity class") are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be [parsed by machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing "Parsing") with limited computational power. 

- In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and the [foundations of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics "Foundations of mathematics"), formal languages are used to represent the syntax of [axiomatic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system"), and [mathematical formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics) "Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)") is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.

- Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of [natural languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language"). The field of formal language theory studies primarily the purely [syntactical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax") aspects of such languages — that is, their internal structural patterns. 


### Automata Theory
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory

**Automata theory** is the study of [abstract machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_machine "Abstract machine") and [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton "Automaton"), as well as the [computational problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem "Computational problem") that can be solved using them. It is a theory in [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science "Theoretical computer science") with close connections to [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"). The word _automata_ comes from the Greek word αὐτόματος, which means "self-acting, self-willed, self-moving". An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a Finite Automaton (FA) or Finite-State Machine (FSM). The figure on the right illustrates a [finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine "Finite-state machine"), which is a well-known type of automaton. This automaton consists of [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science) "State (computer science)") (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows). As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another state, according to its [transition function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_table "Transition table"), which takes the previous state and current input symbol as its arguments.

Automata theory is closely related to [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language") theory. In this context, automata are used as finite representations of formal languages that may be infinite. Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, as in the [Chomsky hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy "Chomsky hierarchy"), which describes a nesting relationship between major classes of automata. Automata play a major role in the [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation "Theory of computation"), [compiler construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_construction "Compiler construction"), [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), [parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing "Parsing") and [formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification "Formal verification").
