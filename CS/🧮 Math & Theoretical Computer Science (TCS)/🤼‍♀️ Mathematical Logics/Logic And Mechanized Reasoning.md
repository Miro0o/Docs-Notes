This course is designed to teach you the mathematical theory behind symbolic logic, with an eye towards putting it to good use. An interesting aspect of the course is that it develops three interacting strands in parallel:
- _Theory._ We will teach you the syntax and semantics of propositional and first-order logic. If time allows, we will give you a brief overview of related topics, like simple type theory and higher-order logic.
- _Implementation._ We will teach you how to implement logical syntax—terms and formulas—in a functional programming language called _Lean_. We will also teach you how to carry out fundamental operations and transformations on these objects.
- _Application._ We will show you how to use logic-based automated reasoning tools to solve interesting and difficult problems. In particular, we will use a SAT solver called CaDiCaL, an SMT solver called Z3, and a first-order theorem prover called Vampire (and by then you will understand what all these terms mean).
