For a 

In [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), an [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) *q* is called a **quadratic residue** [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) *n* if it is [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_relation) to a [perfect square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number) modulo *n*; i.e., if there exists an integer *x* such that:



$$x^{2}\equiv q{\pmod  {n}}.$$



Otherwise, *q* is called a **quadratic nonresidue** modulo *n*.
