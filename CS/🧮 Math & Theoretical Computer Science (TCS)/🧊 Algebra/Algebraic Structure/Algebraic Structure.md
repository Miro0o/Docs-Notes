In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), an **algebraic structure** consists of a nonempty [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)) *A* (called the **underlying set**, **carrier set** or **domain**), a collection of [operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)) on *A* (typically [binary operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation) such as addition and multiplication), and a finite set of [identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics)), known as [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom#Non-logical_axioms), that these operations must satisfy.

An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. For instance, a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) involves a second structure called a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)), and an operation called *scalar multiplication* between elements of the field (called *[scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics))*), and elements of the vector space (called *[vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics))*).

[Abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra) is the name that is commonly given to the study of algebraic structures. ==The general theory of algebraic structures has been formalized in [universal algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra).== [Category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) is another formalization that includes also other [mathematical structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure) and [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) between structures of the same type ([homomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism)).

In universal algebra, an algebraic structure is called an *algebra*;[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure#cite_note-1) this term may be ambiguous, since, in other contexts, [an algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_algebra) is an algebraic structure that is a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) over a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)) or a [module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(ring_theory)) over a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring).

The collection of all structures of a given type (same operations and same laws) is called a [variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(universal_algebra)) in universal algebra; this term is also used with a completely different meaning in [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry), as an abbreviation of [algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety). In category theory, the collection of all structures of a given type and homomorphisms between them form a [concrete category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_category).
