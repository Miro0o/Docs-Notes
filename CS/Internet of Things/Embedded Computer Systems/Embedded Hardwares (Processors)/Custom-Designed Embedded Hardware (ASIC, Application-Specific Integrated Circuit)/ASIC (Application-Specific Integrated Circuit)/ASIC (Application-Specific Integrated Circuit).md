## ASIC Design Principles
Designing full-custom ASICs requires thinking of the chip from three perspectives: From a behavioral perspective, we define exactly what the chip is supposed to do. How do we produce the desired outputs as functions of the inputs? From a structural perspective, we determine which logic components provide the desired behavior. From a physical perspective, we think of how the components should be placed on the silicon die to make the best use of chip real estate and minimize connection distances between the components.
