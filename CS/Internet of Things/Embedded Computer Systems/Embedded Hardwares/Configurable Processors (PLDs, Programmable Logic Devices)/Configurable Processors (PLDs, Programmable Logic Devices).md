# Configurable Processors (PLDs, Programmable Logic Devices)

## Intro
Some applications are so specialized that no off-the-shelf microcontroller can do the job. When designers find themselves in this situation, they can choose between two alternatives: They can elect to create a chip from scratch, or they can employ a **programmable logic device (PLD)**. When speed and die size are not primary concerns, a PLD may be a good choice. 

PLDs come in three general varieties: programmable array logic, programmable logic arrays, and field-programmable gate arrays. Any of these three types of circuits can be used as **glue logic**, or customized circuits that interconnect prefabricated IP circuit elements. 

Programmable logic devices are usually presented along with the combinational logic components.


### CPLDs
PLAs are more flexible than PALs, but they also tend to be slower and more costly than PALs. Thus, the occasional redundancy among PAL min-terms is only a minor inconvenience when speed and cost are important considerations. To maximize functionality and flexibility, PLA and PAL chips usually include several arrays on one silicon die. Both types are referred to as **complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs)**.
