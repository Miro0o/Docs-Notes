## ðŸ‘‰ `mosquitto` cannot connect to remote server: connection refused
**#1 Configuration isn't loading**
`Mosquitto` will not pick up a default configuration file, you must always pass the configuration file with theÂ `-c`Â command line argument or it will fall back to the baked in config (that will only listen on localhost)

The service includesÂ `-c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`Â to force it to use the config file.

**#2 Networking request refused by firewall**

**#3 Connection request refused by mosquitto**

## ðŸ‘‰ `Mosquitto` isn't loading configuration files from conf.d

Mosquitto does not automatically load a configuration file, youÂ **must**Â pass it one on the command line with theÂ `-c`Â flag if you want to use anything other than the default values. When run as a service the service definition include theÂ `-c`Â pointing to the default configuration file.

The default configuration file is normally stored inÂ `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`. This file includes the following line:
```
include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d
```

Which tells mosquitto to include all the files that end inÂ `.conf`Â from theÂ `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d`Â directory

When you tried to run mosquitto without passing it a configuration file it failed because the service was already running. If you stop it (`sudo service mosquitto stop`) and then runÂ `mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`Â it will get a little further but also fail because your user will not have access to either the default persistence file or the log file.
```shell
sudo service mosquitto restart
```

and it will pick up the changes you made inÂ `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/custom.conf`

You should then check the log file (`/var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log`) for indications as to why your anonymous clients are still failing to connect.
