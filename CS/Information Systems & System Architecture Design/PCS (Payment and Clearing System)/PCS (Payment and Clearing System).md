Example Scenario: A Consumer Makes a Purchase
1. **Purchase Initiation**:
    - A consumer uses a credit card to buy a laptop from an online retailer.
2. **Transaction Authorization**:
    - The retailer’s payment system sends the transaction details to the payment network (e.g., VisaNet).
    - VisaNet checks if the consumer’s bank (the issuing bank) has enough credit available.
    - If approved, VisaNet sends an authorization back to the retailer.
3. **Transaction Completion**:
    - The retailer completes the sale and provides the consumer with the laptop.
4. **Settlement Process**:
    - At the end of the day, the retailer’s bank (the acquiring bank) compiles all card transactions it processed.
    - This bank will need to settle these transactions with the issuing banks.
5. **Interbank Payment**:
    - The acquiring bank sends a net payment request to the issuing banks for the total amount of all transactions.
    - This transfer of funds between banks is facilitated through an interbank payment system like CHIPS or another settlement network.
    - The issuing banks transfer the appropriate funds to the acquiring bank.
