## Intro: Information System (IS)
An **information system** (**IS**) is a formal, [sociotechnical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical "Sociotechnical"), organizational system designed to collect, process, [store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_storage "Information storage"), and [distribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_distribution "Information distribution") [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information"). From a sociotechnical perspective, information systems are composed by four components: task, people, structure (or roles), and technology. Information systems can be defined as an integration of components for collection, storage and [processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing") of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data") of which the data is used to provide information, contribute to knowledge as well as [digital products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_product "Digital product") that facilitate [decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making "Decision making")
