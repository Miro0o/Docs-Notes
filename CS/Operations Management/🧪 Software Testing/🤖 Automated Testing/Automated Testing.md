## Intro

In [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing), **test automation** is the use of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) separate from the software being tested to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation#cite_note-1) Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) and [continuous testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_testing).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation#cite_note-2)

There are many approaches to test automation, however below are the general approaches used widely:

- **[Graphical user interface testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface_testing)**. A testing framework that generates [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) events such as keystrokes and mouse clicks, and observes the changes that result in the user interface, to validate that the observable behavior of the program is correct.
- **[API driven testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_testing)**. A testing framework that uses a programming interface to the application to validate the behaviour under test. Typically API driven testing bypasses application user interface altogether. It can also be testing [public (usually) interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interface) to classes, modules or libraries are tested with a variety of input arguments to validate that the results that are returned are correct.

[**Continuous testing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_testing). Continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation#cite_note-essential-10)[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation#cite_note-stickym-11) For Continuous Testing, the scope of testing extends from validating bottom-up requirements or user stories to assessing the system requirements associated with overarching business goals
