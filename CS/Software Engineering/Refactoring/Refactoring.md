### Clean code
> ðŸ”— https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/what-is-refactoring

The main purpose of refactoring is to fight technical debt. It transforms a mess into clean code and simple design.

Nice! But whatâ€™s clean code, anyway? Here are some of its features:

**Clean code is obvious for other programmers.**
And Iâ€™m not talking about super sophisticated algorithms. Poor variable naming, bloated classes and methods, magic numbers -you name it- all of that makes code sloppy and difficult to grasp.

**Clean code doesnâ€™t contain duplication.**
Each time you have to make a change in a duplicate code, you have to remember to make the same change to every instance. This increases the cognitive load and slows down the progress.

**Clean code contains a minimal number of classes and other moving parts.**
Less code is less stuff to keep in your head. Less code is less maintenance. Less code is fewer bugs. Code is liability, keep it short and simple.

**Clean code passes all tests.**
You know your code is dirty when only 95% of your tests passed. You know youâ€™re screwed when your test coverage is 0%.

**Clean code is easier and cheaper to maintain!**
