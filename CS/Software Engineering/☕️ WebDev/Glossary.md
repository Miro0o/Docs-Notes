##### [YAML vs JSON vs XML | What is the Difference Between Them?](https://www.csestack.org/yaml-vs-json-vs-xml-difference/) #unsolved

###### Differences:

YAML(YAL), JSON and XML are all widely used data serialization language.

- YAML stands for “*YAML Aint Markup Language*“.
- JSON stands for “*JavaScript Object Notation*“.
- XML is “*eXtensible Markup Language”* whereas YML is not a markup language.
- YAML uses indentation to define structured data. So each block in the YAML is differentiated by the number of white spaces.
- XML uses a tag to define the structure just like HTML.
- All three mentioned serialization language has same extension as their name. (.yaml for YAML, .json for JSON, .xml for XML). So it is easy to remember.
- In fact, file extensions are arbitrary for all the three data serialization standard. It is useful for the application and users to know what files format, type of the content and their data structure.

###### How to choose ?

##### CGI

一个请求对应一个CGI， 一个CGI 对应一个进程。

FCGI 利用一个常驻内存的进程池提高了反应效率。

Java发明的Servlet技术也是一种常驻内存的网关通信技术，只不过它采用的是多线程而非进程。
