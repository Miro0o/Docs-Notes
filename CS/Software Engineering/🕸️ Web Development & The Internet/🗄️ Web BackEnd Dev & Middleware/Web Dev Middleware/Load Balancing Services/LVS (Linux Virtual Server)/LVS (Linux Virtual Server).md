### What is the Linux Virtual Server?
The Linux Virtual Server is a highly scalable and highly available server built on a cluster of real servers, with the [load balancer](http://kb.linuxvirtualserver.org/wiki/Load_balancer) running on the Linux operating system. The architecture of the server cluster is fully transparent to end users, and the users interact as if it were a single high-performance virtual server.
