## Res


## Intro
[Apache Traffic Server](https://trafficserver.apache.org/), an open-source, fast, scalable, and extensible caching proxy server with support for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.0. It is designed to improve network efficiency and performance by caching frequently-accessed content at the edge of a network, for enterprises, ISPs (Internet Server Providers), backbone providers, and more.

It supports both forward and reverse proxying of HTTP/HTTPS traffic. It may also be configured to run in either or both modes simultaneously. It features persistent caching, plugin APIs; support for ICP(Internet Cache Protocol), ESI(Edge Side Includes); Keep-ALive, and more.

In terms of security, Traffic Server supports controlling client access by allowing you to configure clients that are allowed to use the proxy cache, SSL termination for both connections between clients and itself, and between itself and the origin server. It also supports authentication and basic authorization via a plugin, logging(of every request it receives and every error it detects), and monitoring.

Traffic Server can be used as a web proxy cache, forward proxy, reverse proxy, transparent proxy, load balancer, or in a cache hierarchy.
