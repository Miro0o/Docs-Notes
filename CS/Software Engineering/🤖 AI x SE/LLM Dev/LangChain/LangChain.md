【简直逆天！我居然只花了2小时就掌握了吴恩达教授讲的【LangChain+ChatGLM-6B】LLM应用开发实践！强烈推荐！！   人工智能|深度学习】 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pz4y1e7T9/?p=6&share_source=copy_web&vd_source=7740584ebdab35221363fc24d1582d9d



## Intro
Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:
