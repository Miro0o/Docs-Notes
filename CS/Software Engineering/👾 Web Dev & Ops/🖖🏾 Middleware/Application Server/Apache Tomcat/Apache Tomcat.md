## Intro
The Apache Tomcat® software is an open source implementation of the [Jakarta Servlet](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.servlet), [Jakarta Server Pages](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jsp), [Jakarta Expression Language](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.el), [Jakarta WebSocket](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.websocket), [Jakarta Annotations](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.ca) and[Jakarta Authentication](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.authentication) specifications. These specifications are part of the [Jakarta EE platform](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-platform).

The Jakarta EE platform is the evolution of the Java EE platform. Tomcat 10 and later implement specifications developed as part of Jakarta EE. Tomcat 9 and earlier implement specifications developed as part of Java EE.

The Apache Tomcat software is developed in an open and participatory environment and released under the [Apache License version 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/). The Apache Tomcat project is intended to be a collaboration of the best-of-breed developers from around the world. We invite you to participate in this open development project.

Apache Tomcat software powers numerous large-scale, mission-critical web applications across a diverse range of industries and organizations. Some of these users and their stories are listed on the [PoweredBy](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TOMCAT/PoweredBy) wiki page.
