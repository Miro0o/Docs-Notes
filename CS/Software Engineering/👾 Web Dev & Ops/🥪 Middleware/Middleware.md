## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware

**Middleware** is a type of computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. It can be described as "software glue

In recent bibliography, the main categories of middleware are the following:
- **Transactional**: Processing of multiple synchronous/ asynchronous transactions, serving as a cluster of associated requests from distributed systems such as bank transactions or credit card payments.
- **Message-oriented**: Message queue and message passing architectures, which support synchronous/asynchronous communication.
- **Procedural**: Remote and local architectures to connect, pass, and retrieve software responses of asynchronous systems communications such as a call operation.
- **Object-oriented**: Similar to procedural middleware, however, this type of middleware incorporates object-oriented programming design principles. Analytically, its software component encompasses object references, exceptions, and inheritance of properties via distributed object requests.
