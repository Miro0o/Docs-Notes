### Intro
GitBook is a modern documentation platform where teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge bases and APIs.

We want to help **teams to work more efficiently** by creating a simple yet powerful platform for them to **share their knowledge**.

Our mission is to make a **user-friendly** and **collaborative** product for everyone to create, edit and share knowledge through documentation.
