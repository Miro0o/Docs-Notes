## ğŸ‘‰ "Could not resolve dependency," error when running "vue upgrade"
#vue #js #web #frontend #npm 

You are likely using npm version 7. (Using npm version 7, I was able to replicate your error based on your error message.) The easiest solutions are:

- UseÂ `npm`'sÂ `--legacy-peer-deps`Â flag
- UseÂ `npm`Â version 6 (where the behavior ofÂ `npm`Â version 7'sÂ `--legacy-peer-deps`Â flag is the default)

The tutorial and packages were probably written and tested withÂ `npm`Â version 6 (or maybe 5 or 4). Lots of existing projects run into thisÂ `ERESOLVE`Â error inÂ `npm`Â version 7 because that version started treating peer dependencies problems as errors instead of advisory issues that could be ignored.
