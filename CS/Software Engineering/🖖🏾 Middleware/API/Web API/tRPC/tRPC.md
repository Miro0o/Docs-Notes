## Intro
tRPC allows you to easily build & consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.

As TypeScript and static typing increasingly becomes a best practice in web development, API contracts present a major pain point. We need better ways to **statically type** our API endpoints and **share those types** between our client and server (or server-to-server). We set out to build a simple library for building typesafe APIs that leverages the full power of modern TypeScript.
