# Load Balancing

## Res


## Intro
A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load balancing usually involves dedicated software or hardware, such as a multilayer switch or a Domain Name Service server process.

Load Balancing can be classified into two types based on the behavior of the algorithm:
- **Static Load Balancing:** Static load balancing is the method of dividing the incoming load on a server using algorithms that have prior information about the existing servers in the distributed network. These load balancing schemes have a pre-defined load schedule that determines a fixed amount of load that can be shed on other systems.
- **Dynamic Load Balancing:** It is a more versatile scheme of load balancing which can dynamically identify the amount of load that needs to be shed during runtime and which system should bear the load.
