## Intro
Angie /[ˈendʒi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)/ is an efficient, powerful, and scalable web server that was forked from nginx:
- Conceived by ex-devs from the original team to venture beyond the earlier vision and act as a drop-in replacement without major changes to module setup or configuration.
- Includes all capabilities of [nginx 1.25.3](https://nginx.org/en/CHANGES) and a number of [new features](https://angie.software/en/#index-features).

We build binary packages for a range of [systems and architectures](https://angie.software/en/install/), as well as [Docker images](https://angie.software/en/install/#install-docker). The source code is open in our [public repositories](https://angie.software/en/oss_contribution/) under a [BSD-like license](https://angie.software/en/license/).
