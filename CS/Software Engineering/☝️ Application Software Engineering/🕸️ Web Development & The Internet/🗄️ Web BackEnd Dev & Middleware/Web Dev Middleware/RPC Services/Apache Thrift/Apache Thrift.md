## Intro
Thrift is a lightweight, language-independent software stack for point-to-point RPC implementation. Thrift provides clean abstractions and implementations for data transport, data serialization, and application level processing. The code generation system takes a simple definition language as input and generates code across programming languages that uses the abstracted stack to build interoperable RPC clients and servers.

Thrift makes it easy for programs written in different programming languages to share data and call remote procedures. With support for [28 programming languages](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/LANGUAGES.md), chances are Thrift supports the languages that you currently use.

Thrift is specifically designed to support non-atomic version changes across client and server code. This allows you to upgrade your server while still being able to service older clients; or have newer clients issue requests to older servers. An excellent community-provided write-up about thrift and compatibility when versioning an API can be found in the [Thrift Missing Guide](https://diwakergupta.github.io/thrift-missing-guide/#_versioning_compatibility).

For more details on Thrift's design and implementation, see the Thrift whitepaper included in this distribution, or at the README.md file in your particular subdirectory of interest.
