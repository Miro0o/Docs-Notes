## Intro
Appium is an open-source, cross-platform test automation tool for native, hybrid, **mobile web and desktop** apps. Initially created to automate iOS and Android mobile applications Appium has grown to a full-featured platform that provides [WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)-based automation possibilities for the whole set of different mobile and desktop platforms. See the full list of [officially-supported](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/#drivers) and [third-party](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/ecosystem/#other-drivers) drivers for more details.

‼️ Major documentation revision in progress

‼️ Appium core team does not maintain Appium 1.x anymore since the 1st of January 2022. All recent versions of officially supported platform drivers are not compatible to Appium 1.x anymore, and require Appium 2 to run. [Please read the migration guide from 1.x to 2.0](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/guides/migrating-1-to-2/) to manage the Appium server.

Appium is in the final stages of a major revision (to version 2.0). As such, the documentation found around the web may not be correct. The current Appium 2.0 documentation is very much in progress. Currently, it can be found [here](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/).
