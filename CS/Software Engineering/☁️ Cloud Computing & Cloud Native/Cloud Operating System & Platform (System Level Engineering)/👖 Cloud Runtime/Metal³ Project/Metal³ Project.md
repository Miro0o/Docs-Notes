## Intro
The Metal³ project (pronounced: “Metal Kubed”) provides components for bare metal host management with Kubernetes. You can enrol your bare metal machines, provision operating system images, and then, if you like, deploy Kubernetes clusters to them. From there, operating and upgrading your Kubernetes clusters can be handled by Metal³. Moreover, Metal³ is itself a Kubernetes application, so it runs on Kubernetes, and uses Kubernetes resources and APIs as its interface.
