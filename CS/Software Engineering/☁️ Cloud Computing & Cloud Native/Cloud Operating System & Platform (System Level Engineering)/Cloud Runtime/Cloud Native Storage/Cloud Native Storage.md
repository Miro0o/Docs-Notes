## Intro
Storage is where the persistent data of an app is stored, often referred to as a persistent volume. To function reliably, applications need to have easy access to storage. Generally, when we say persistent data, we mean storing things like databases, messages, or any other information we want to ensure doesn’t disappear when an app gets restarted.
