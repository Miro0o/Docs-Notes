## Intro
While humans generally interact with computer programs via a GUI (graphical user interface) such as a web page or a desktop application, computers interact with each other through APIs (application programming interfaces). But an API shouldn't be confused with an API gateway.

An API gateway allows organizations to move key functions, such as authorizing or limiting the number of requests between applications, to a centrally managed location. It also functions as a common interface to (often external) API consumers.
