## 👉 Docker Network
#docker #network 

### Change Docker Network
When you start a container, such as: 
```shell
docker run -d --name alpine1 alpine
```

It is by default connected to the `bridge` network, check it with:
```shell
docker container inspect alpine1
```

If you try to connect it to `host` network with:
```shell
docker network connect host alpine1
```

you obtain an error:
> Error response from daemon: container cannot be disconnected from host network or connected to host network

you have to delete the container and run it again on the host network:
```shell
docker stop alpine1
docker rm alpine1
docker run -d --network host --name alpine1 alpine
```

This limitation is not present on bridge networks. You can start a container:
```shell
docker run -d --name alpine2 alpine
```

disconnect it from the bridge network and reconnect it to another bridge network.
```shell
docker network disconnect bridge alpine2
docker network create --driver bridge alpine-net
docker network connect alpine-net alpine2
```

Note also that according to the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/):

> The host networking driver only works on Linux hosts, and is not supported on Docker Desktop for Mac, Docker Desktop for Windows, or Docker EE for Windows Server.

## 👉 Multiple Docker containers, same image, different config
#docker 

Just run from the same image as many times as needed. New containers will be created and they can then be started and stoped each one saving its own configuration. For your convenience would be better to give each of your containers a name with "--name".


P.S.
Other answers in the posts list several usages about configurations. Refer to them if needed. 👇

## 👉 Docker 🆚 Podman
![](../../../../../../Assets/Pics/Pasted%20image%2020231002213140.png)

Podman and Docker have their benefits. While Podman scores more in security, Docker takes the lead in the image development department. Hence, you can move back and forth between the two tools for your operation’s requirements. And as both of them are OCI compliant, compatibility isn’t an issue.

Usually, developers prefer Podman for production to leverage its security feature and Docker for development to easily work around image building.

Overall, Podman cannot always work as a replacement for Docker. But you can definitely use it as your primary containerization tool if you are starting a project. Otherwise, Podman and Docker work well together, and you can employ both for different purposes.

## 👉 Container exited with code 0
#docker #container 

The answer is actually the first comment. I'll explain Miguel's comment a bit.

First, we need to understand that a Docker container runs a single command. The container will be running as long as that process the command started is running. Once the process is completed and exits then the container will stop.

With that understanding, we can make an assumption of what is happening in your case. When you start your `dvpt` service it runs the command `mkdir /root/essai/`. That command creates the folder and then exits. At this point, the Docker container is stopped because the process exited (with status 0, indicating that `mkdir` completed with no error).
