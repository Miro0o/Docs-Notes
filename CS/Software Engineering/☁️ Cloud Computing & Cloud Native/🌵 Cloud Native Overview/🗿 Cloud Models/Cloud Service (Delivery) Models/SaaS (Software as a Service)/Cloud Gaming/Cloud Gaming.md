## Intro
One of the most well known gaming platforms is NVIDIA’S [**GeForce Now For Mac**](https://machow2.com/geforce-now-mac-review/) which allows Mac users to play Windows only games in the Cloud such as [**Fortnite**](https://machow2.com/play-fortnite-save-world-mac/).

There are other major cloud gaming platforms that also work on Mac, the biggest ones being [**Microsoft Xbox Game Pass**](https://machow2.com/play-xbox-games-mac/) and Amazon Luna

There are also cloud computer services like [airGPU](https://airgpu.com/) which allow you to “rent” a virtual PC in the Cloud by the hour on which you can install and play Windows only games that aren’t available on other cloud gaming platforms such as [**Diablo 4**](https://machow2.com/diablo-4-mac/).

Alternatively, a [Shadow subscription](https://shadow.tech/) starts at $39.99 per month for a cloud gaming PC with an Nvidia GTX 1080s graphics card with unlimited game play time and 250GB SSD drive space which may work out cheaper than paying hourly with airGPU.

> You’ll also need to use a remote desktop app to connect to your Mac to a cloud gaming PC on either airGPU or Shadow.
> 
> We recommend using Parsec for this as it’s designed specifically for the needs of gaming remotely. You can download the [Parsec Mac desktop app](https://parsec.app/downloads) for free without having to subscribe to a Parsec hosting plan although you can also pay for cloud game hosting with Parsec too.
