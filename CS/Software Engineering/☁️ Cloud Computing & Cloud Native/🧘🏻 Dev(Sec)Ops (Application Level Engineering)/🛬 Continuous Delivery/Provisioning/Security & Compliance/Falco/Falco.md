## Intro
[Falco](https://falco.org/)Â is a cloud native runtime security tool for Linux operating systems. It is designed to detect and alert on abnormal behavior and potential security threats in real-time.

At its core, Falco is a kernel monitoring and detection agent that observes events, such as syscalls, based on custom rules. Falco can enhance these events by integrating metadata from the container runtime and Kubernetes. The collected events can be analyzed off-host in SIEM or data lake systems.

Falco, originally created byÂ [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/), is an incubating project under theÂ [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/)Â (CNCF) used in production by variousÂ [organisations](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md).

For detailed technical information and insights into the cyber threats that Falco can detect, visit the officialÂ [Falco](https://falco.org/)website.
