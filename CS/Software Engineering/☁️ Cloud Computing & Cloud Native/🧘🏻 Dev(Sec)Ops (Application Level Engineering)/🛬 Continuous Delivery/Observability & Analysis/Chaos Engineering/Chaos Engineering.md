[TOC]



## Res



## Intro
Chaos engineering refers to the practice of intentionally introducing faults into a system in order to test its resilience and ensure applications and engineering teams are able to withstand turbulent and unexpected events. A chaos engineering tool will provide a controlled way to introduce faults and run specific experiments against a particular instance of an application.
