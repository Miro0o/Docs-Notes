## Intro
Monitoring refers to instrumenting an app to collect, aggregate, and analyze logs and metrics to improve our understanding of its behavior. While logs describe specific events, metrics are a measurement of a system at a given point in time — they are two different things but both necessary to get the full picture of your system's health. Monitoring includes everything from watching disk space, CPU usage, and memory consumption on individual nodes to doing detailed synthetic transactions to see if a system or application is responding correctly and in a timely manner. There are a number of different approaches to monitor systems and applications.
