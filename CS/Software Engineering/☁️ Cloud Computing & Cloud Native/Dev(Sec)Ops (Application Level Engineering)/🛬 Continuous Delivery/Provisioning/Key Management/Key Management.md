## Intro
Before digging into key management, let's first define cryptographic keys. A key is a string of characters used to encrypt or sign data. Like a physical key, it locks (encrypts) data so that only someone with the right key can unlock (decrypt) it.

As applications and operations adapt to a new cloud native world, security tools are evolving to meet new security needs. The tools and projects in this category cover everything from how to securely store passwords and other secrets (sensitive data such as API keys, encryption keys, etc.) to how to safely eliminate passwords and secrets from your microservices environment.
