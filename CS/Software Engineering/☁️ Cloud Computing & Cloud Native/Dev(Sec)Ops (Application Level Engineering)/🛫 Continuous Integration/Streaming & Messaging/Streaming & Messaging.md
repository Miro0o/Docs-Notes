## Intro
To accomplish a common goal, services need to communicate with one another and keep each other in the loop. Each time a service does something, it sends a message about that particular event.

Streaming and messaging tools enable **service-to-service communication** by transporting messages (i.e. events) between systems. Individual services connect to the messaging service to either publish events, read messages from other services, or both. This dynamic creates an environment where individual apps are either publishers, meaning they write events, or subscribers that read events, or more likely both.
