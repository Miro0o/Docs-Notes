## Intro
> 🔗 [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a light editor developed by ms. VScode is just a editor itself like ↗ [Tex & LaTex Editors](../../Integrated%20CASE%20Tools/Docs%20Tools/Tex%20&%20LaTex%20Editors/Tex%20&%20LaTex%20Editors.md) or ↗ [Typora](../../Integrated%20CASE%20Tools/Docs%20Tools/Markdown%20Related%20Tools/Typora.md) or ↗ [SublimeText](../../../../🔑%20CS_Core/👩‍💻%20Programming%20Methodology%20and%20Languages/🛠️%20Programming%20Tools%20Chain/Text%20Editors/SublimeText/SublimeText.md) or whatsoever. but additionally it is extendable, which means users can add as many extensions as they like as long as the extension is supported by ms and make it more than a just editor. (in fact all editors mentioned above are not just an "editor", each of them has its own edges.)
