## Intro
### \# intro1
CASE tools are a set of software application programs, which are used to automate SDLC activities. CASE tools are used by software project managers, analysts and engineers to develop software system. 

There are a number of CASE tools available to simplify various stages of Software Development Life Cycle such as Analysis tools, Design tools, Project management tools, Database Management tools, and Documentation tools are to name a few. 

The use of CASE tools accelerates the development of project to produce desired result and helps to uncover flaws before moving ahead with next stage in software development.


### \# intro2
**Computer-aided software engineering** (**CASE**) is the domain of software tools used to design and implement applications. CASE tools are similar to and were partly inspired by [Computer-Aided Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-Aided_Design "Computer-Aided Design")(CAD) tools used for designing hardware products. CASE tools were used for developing high-quality, defect-free, and maintainable software. CASE software is often associated with methods for the development of [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system "Information system") together with automated tools that can be used in the [software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)



## Components of CASE Tools
CASE tools can be broadly divided into the following parts based on their use at a particular SDLC stage:

- **Central Repository** - CASE tools require a central repository, which can serve as a source of common, integrated and consistent information. Central repository is a central place of storage where product specifications, requirement documents, related reports and diagrams, other useful information regarding management is stored. Central repository also serves as data dictionary.
- **Upper Case Tools** - Upper CASE tools are used in planning, analysis and design stages of SDLC.
- **Lower Case Tools** - Lower CASE tools are used in implementation, testing and maintenance.
- **Integrated Case Tools** - Integrated CASE tools are helpful in all the stages of SDLC, from Requirement gathering to Testing and documentation.
