> [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a light editor developed by ms. VScode is just a editor itself  like [[Tex]] or [[../../../Integrated CASE/Documentation Tools/Markdown/Typora]] or [[Sublime]] or whatsoever. but additionally it is extendable, which means users can add as many extensions as they like as long as the extension is supported by ms and make it more than a just editor. (in fact all editors mentioned above are not just an "editor", each of them has its own edges.)
