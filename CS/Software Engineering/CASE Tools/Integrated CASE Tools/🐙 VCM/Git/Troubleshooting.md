## ðŸ‘‰ Recover from an unsuccessful git rebase with the `git reflog` command

1. use `git reflog` listing the commit history
```shell
$ git reflog 222967b (HEAD -> main)
HEAD@{0}: rebase (finish): returning to refs/heads/main 222967b (HEAD -> main) 
HEAD@{1}: rebase (squash): My big rebase c388f0c 
HEAD@{2}: rebase (squash): # This is a combination of 20 commits 56ee04d 
HEAD@{3}: rebase (start): checkout HEAD~20 0a0f875 
HEAD@{4}: commit: An old good commit [...]
```

2. find the last good commit that you want to recover. For example HEAD{3} here.
3. Restore the commit
```shell
git checkout HEAD{3}
```

4. merge commits (optional)

## ðŸ‘‰ Git: Merge a Remote branch locally
You can reference those remote tracking branches ~(listed withÂ `git branch -r`) with the name of their remote.

You need to fetch the remote branch:
```
git fetch origin aRemoteBranch
```

If you want to merge one of those remote branches on your local branch:
```
git checkout aLocalBranch
git merge origin/aRemoteBranch
```

_Note 1:_Â For a large repo with a long history, you will want to add theÂ `--depth=1`Â option when you useÂ `git fetch`.

_Note 2:_Â These commands also work with other remote repos so you can setup anÂ `origin`Â and anÂ `upstream`Â if you are working on a fork.

_Note 3_:Â [user3265569](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3265569/user3265569)Â suggests the following aliasÂ [in the comments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21651185/git-merge-a-remote-branch-locally/21653559#comment116902338_21653559):

> FromÂ `aLocalBranch`, runÂ `git combine remoteBranch`  
> Alias:

> combine = !git fetch origin ${1} && git merge origin/${1}

## ðŸ‘‰ How do I fix a Git detached head?
Detached head means you are no longer on a branch, you have checked out a single commit in the history (in this case the commit previous to HEAD, i.e. HEAD^).


**If you want toÂ _delete_Â your changes associated with the detached HEAD**
You only need to checkout the branch you were on, e.g.
``` shell
git checkout master
```
Next time you have changed a file and want to restore it to the state it is in the index, don't delete the file first, just do
``` shell
git checkout -- path/to/foo
```
This will restore the file foo to the state it is in the index.


**If you want toÂ _keep_Â your changes associated with the detached HEAD**
1. RunÂ `git branch tmp`Â - this will save your changes in a new branch calledÂ `tmp`.
2. RunÂ `git checkout master`
3. If you would like to incorporate the changes you made intoÂ `master`, runÂ `git merge tmp`from theÂ `master`Â branch. You should be on theÂ `master`Â branch after runningÂ `git checkout master`.

## ðŸ‘‰ How do I force "git pull" to overwrite local files?
> âš  Warning:
> 
> Any uncommitted local change to tracked files will be lost,Â **even if staged**.
> 
> But any local file that'sÂ _not_Â tracked by Git willÂ _not_Â be affected.

---

First, update allÂ `origin/<branch>`Â refs to latest:
```bash
git fetch --all
```
Backup your current branch (e.g.Â `master`):
``` shell
git branch backup-master
```
Jump to the latest commit onÂ `origin/master`Â and checkout those files:
``` shell
git reset --hard origin/master
```

**Explanation**
`git fetch`Â downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.

`git reset`Â resets the master branch to what you just fetched. TheÂ `--hard`Â option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files inÂ `origin/master`.


**Maintain current local commits**
âš  It's worth noting that it is possible to maintain current local commits by creating a branch fromÂ `master`Â before resetting:
```bash
git checkout master
git branch new-branch-to-save-current-commits
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

After this, all of the old commits will be kept inÂ `new-branch-to-save-current-commits`.


**Uncommitte changes**
Uncommitted changes, even if staged (withÂ `git add`), will be lost. Make sure toÂ `stash`Â or commit anything you need. For example, run the following:
``` shell
git stash
```

And later (afterÂ `git reset`), reapply these uncommitted changes:
``` shell
git stash pop
```

> Which may create merge conflicts.
