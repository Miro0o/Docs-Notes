## Software Engineering in a Nutshell
> 🔗 [software engineering tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/software-engineering)

the **software** is a collection of integrated programs.

software subsists of carefully-organized instructions and code written by developers on any of various particular computer languages.

computer programs and related documentation such as requirements, design models and user manuals.

**engineering** is the application of **scientific** and **practical** knowledge to **invent, design, build, maintain**, and **improve frameworks, processes, etc**.

**Software Engineering** is an engineering branch related to the evolution of software product using well-defined scientific principles, techniques, and procedures. The result of software engineering is an effective and reliable software product.



## Software Processes
A software process is the set of activities and associated outcome that produce a software product. Software engineers mostly carry out these activities. These are four key process activities, which are common to all software processes. These activities are:

1. **Software specifications:** The functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined.
2. **Software development:** The software to meet the requirement must be produced.
3. **Software validation:** The software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants.
4. **Software evolution:** The software must evolve to meet changing client needs.

> 🆚 Program vs. Software
>
> Software is more than programs. Any program is a subset of software, and it becomes software only if documentation & operating procedures manuals are prepared.



### Software Process Model
A software life cycle model (also termed process model) is a pictorial and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. A life cycle model represents all the methods required to make a software product transit through its life cycle stages. It also captures the structure in which these methods are to be undertaken.

## Software Requirement
### Requirement Engineering
**Requirements engineering (RE)** refers to the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. Requirement engineering provides the appropriate mechanism to understand what the customer desires, analyzing the need, and assessing feasibility, negotiating a reasonable solution, specifying the solution clearly, validating the specifications and managing the requirements as they are transformed into a working system. Thus, requirement engineering is the disciplined application of proven principles, methods, tools, and notation to describe a proposed system's intended behavior and its associated constraints.
