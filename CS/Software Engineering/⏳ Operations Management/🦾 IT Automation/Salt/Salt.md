SaltStack, also known as Salt, is a [configuration management](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/configuration-management-CM) and orchestration tool. It uses a central repository to provision new servers and other [IT infrastructure](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/infrastructure), to make changes to existing ones, and to install software in IT environments, including physical and virtual servers, as well as the cloud.

SaltStack automates repeated [system administrative](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/IT-operations) and code deployment tasks, eliminating manual processes in a way that can reduce errors that occur when IT organizations configure systems.

Salt is used in [DevOps](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/DevOps) organizations because it pulls developer code and configuration information from a central code repository, such as GitHub or Subversion, and pushes that content remotely out to servers. Salt users can write their own scripts and programs, and can download prebuilt configurations that other users have contributed to a public repository.
