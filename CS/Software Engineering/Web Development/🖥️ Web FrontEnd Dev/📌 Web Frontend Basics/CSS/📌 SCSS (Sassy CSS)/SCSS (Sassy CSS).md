# SCSS (Sassy CSS)

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
The most commonly used syntax is known as “SCSS” (for “Sassy CSS”), and is a superset of CSS3's syntax. This means that every valid CSS3 stylesheet is valid SCSS as well. SCSS files use the extension .scss. The second, older syntax is known as the indented syntax (or just “.sass”) [https://responsivedesign.is/articles/difference-between-sass-and-scss/](https://responsivedesign.is/articles/difference-between-sass-and-scss/)
