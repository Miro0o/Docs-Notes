## ðŸ‘‰ Git: Could not resolve host github.com error while cloning remote repository in git
#git #remote_git #git_cloning

**Error: "fatal: unable to access 'https://domain.com' Could not resolve host: github.com"**

It seems to be the proxy problem. Somehow the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` is directed to the wrong address / protocols / other things. Reconfig `~/.gitrc` .
