## Intro
> 🔗 [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a light editor developed by ms. VScode is just a editor itself like ↗ [Tex & LaTex Editors](../../Integrated%20CASE%20Tools/Docs%20Tools/Tex%20&%20LaTex%20Editors/Tex%20&%20LaTex%20Editors.md) or ↗ [Typora](../../Integrated%20CASE%20Tools/Docs%20Tools/Markdown%20Related%20Tools/Typora.md) or ↗ [SublimeText](../../../../🔑%20CS_Core/👩‍💻%20Programming%20Methodology%20and%20Languages/🛠️%20Programming%20Tools%20Chain/Text%20Editors/SublimeText/SublimeText.md) or whatsoever. but additionally it is extendable, which means users can add as many extensions as they like as long as the extension is supported by ms and make it more than a just editor. (in fact all editors mentioned above are not just an "editor", each of them has its own edges.)

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).

[Can I compile and debug (run) a single C++ file in Visual Studio 2012? (How to avoid creating too many projects) | Stackoverflow]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/16626536/16542494

While trying to figure out how to use Visual Studio for the very same purpose you asked, I observed and found that for a C++ project, there should be only one starting point, that is, only one `main()` function.

So, instead of creating a new project every time, **just change the name of (`main()`) functions in the unused C++ files to something else**, like the filename or anything.
