Although [definitions of music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_music "Definition of music") vary wildly throughout the world, every known [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture "Culture") partakes in it, and it is thus considered a [cultural universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universal "Cultural universal"). The [origins of music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_music#Origins) remain highly contentious; commentators often relate it to the [origin of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language "Origin of language"), with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before, after or simultaneously with [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"). Many theories have been proposed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, though none has achieved broad approval. Most cultures have their own [mythical origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_myth "Origin myth") concerning the invention of music, generally rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs.

The [music of prehistoric cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_music "Prehistoric music") is first firmly dated to c. 38,000 [BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Christ "Before Christ") of the [Upper Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic "Upper Paleolithic") by evidence of [bone flutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_flutes "Bone flutes"), though it remains unclear whether or not the actual origins lie in the earlier [Middle Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Paleolithic "Middle Paleolithic") period (300,000 to [50,000 BP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50,000_BP "50,000 BP")). There is little known about prehistoric music, with traces mainly limited to some simple flutes and percussion instruments. However, such evidence indicates that music existed to some extent in prehistoric societies such as the [Xia dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty "Xia dynasty") and the [Indus Valley civilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_civilisation "Indus Valley civilisation"). Upon the development of writing, the music of [literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate "Literate") civilizations—[ancient music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_music "Ancient music")—was present in the major Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Persian, Mesopotamian, and Middle Eastern societies. It is difficult to make many generalizations about ancient music as a whole, but from what is known it was often characterized by [monophony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophony "Monophony") and [improvisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation "Improvisation"). In ancient [song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song "Song") forms, the texts were closely aligned with music, and though the oldest extant musical notation survives from this period, many texts survive without their accompanying music, such as the _[Rigveda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda "Rigveda")_ and the [_Shijing_ Classic of Poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shijing "Shijing"). The eventual emergence of the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road "Silk Road") and increasing contact between cultures led to the transmission and exchange of musical ideas, practices, and instruments. Such interaction led to the [Tang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty")'s music being heavily influenced by Central Asian traditions, while the Tang dynasty's music, the Japanese _[gagaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gagaku "Gagaku")_ and [Korean court music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_court_music "Korean court music") each influenced each other.

Historically, religions have often been catalysts for music. The [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas") of [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") immensely influenced [Indian classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_classical_music "Indian classical music"), and the [Five Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Classics "Five Classics") of [Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism "Confucianism") laid the basis for subsequent [Chinese music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_music "Chinese music"). Following the rapid [spread of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_of_Islam "Spread of Islam") in the 7th century, [Islamic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_music "Islamic music") dominated Persia and the Arab world, and the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age") saw the presence of numerous important music theorists. Music written for and by the [early Christian Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christian_Church "Early Christian Church") properly inaugurates the [Western classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_classical_music "Western classical music") tradition, which continues into [medieval music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_music "Medieval music") where [polyphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony "Polyphony"), [staff notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_notation "Staff notation") and nascent forms of many modern instruments developed. In addition to religion or the lack thereof, a society's music is influenced by all other aspects of its culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology. Many cultures have coupled music with other art forms, such as the Chinese [four arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_arts "Four arts") and the medieval _[quadrivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium "Quadrivium")_. The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward [musicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician "Musician") and [composers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer "Composer") all vary between regions and periods. Many cultures have or continue to distinguish between [art music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_music "Art music") (or 'classical music'), [folk music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music"), and [popular music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music "Popular music").

## 20th ~ 21th Century
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_music#20th_century

The 20th century saw a revolution in music listening as the radio gained popularity worldwide and new media and technologies were developed to record, edit and distribute music. Music performances became increasingly visual with the broadcast and recording of performances.[157]

20th-century music brought new freedom and wide experimentation with new musical styles and forms that challenged the accepted rules of music of earlier periods.[citation needed] The invention of musical amplification and electronic instruments, especially the synthesizer, in the mid-20th century revolutionized classical and popular music, and accelerated the development of new forms of music.[158]

As for classical music, two fundamental schools determined the course of the century: that of Arnold Schoenberg and that of Igor Stravinsky.[159] However, other composers also had a notable influence. For example: Béla Bartók, Anton Webern, Dmitri Shostakovich, Olivier Messiaen, John Cage, Benjamin Britten, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Sofia Gubaidulina, Krzysztof Penderecki, Brian Ferneyhough, Kaija Saariaho.[160]

The 20th century saw the unprecedented dissemination of popular music, that is, music with a wide appeal.[n 22] The term has its roots in the music of the American Tin Pan Alley, a group of prominent musicians and publishers who began to emerge during the 1880s in New York City. Although popular music is sometimes known as "pop music", the terms are not always interchangeable.[162] Popular music refers to a variety of music genres that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population,[163] whereas pop music usually refers to a specific genre within popular music.[164] Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable melodies. The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections, with the verse and chorus or refrain repeating throughout the song and the bridge providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece.[165]
