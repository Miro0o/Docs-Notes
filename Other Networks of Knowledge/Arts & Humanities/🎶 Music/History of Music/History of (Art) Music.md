Although [definitions of music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_music "Definition of music") vary wildly throughout the world, every known [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture "Culture") partakes in it, and it is thus considered a [cultural universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universal "Cultural universal"). The [origins of music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_music#Origins) remain highly contentious; commentators often relate it to the [origin of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language "Origin of language"), with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before, after or simultaneously with [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"). Many theories have been proposed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, though none has achieved broad approval. Most cultures have their own [mythical origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_myth "Origin myth") concerning the invention of music, generally rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs.

The [music of prehistoric cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_music "Prehistoric music") is first firmly dated to c. 38,000 [BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Christ "Before Christ") of the [Upper Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic "Upper Paleolithic") by evidence of [bone flutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_flutes "Bone flutes"), though it remains unclear whether or not the actual origins lie in the earlier [Middle Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Paleolithic "Middle Paleolithic") period (300,000 to [50,000 BP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50,000_BP "50,000 BP")). There is little known about prehistoric music, with traces mainly limited to some simple flutes and percussion instruments. However, such evidence indicates that music existed to some extent in prehistoric societies such as the [Xia dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty "Xia dynasty") and the [Indus Valley civilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_civilisation "Indus Valley civilisation"). Upon the development of writing, the music of [literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate "Literate") civilizations—[ancient music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_music "Ancient music")—was present in the major Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Persian, Mesopotamian, and Middle Eastern societies. It is difficult to make many generalizations about ancient music as a whole, but from what is known it was often characterized by [monophony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophony "Monophony") and [improvisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation "Improvisation"). In ancient [song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song "Song") forms, the texts were closely aligned with music, and though the oldest extant musical notation survives from this period, many texts survive without their accompanying music, such as the _[Rigveda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda "Rigveda")_ and the [_Shijing_ Classic of Poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shijing "Shijing"). The eventual emergence of the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road "Silk Road") and increasing contact between cultures led to the transmission and exchange of musical ideas, practices, and instruments. Such interaction led to the [Tang dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty")'s music being heavily influenced by Central Asian traditions, while the Tang dynasty's music, the Japanese _[gagaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gagaku "Gagaku")_ and [Korean court music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_court_music "Korean court music") each influenced each other.

Historically, religions have often been catalysts for music. The [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas") of [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism") immensely influenced [Indian classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_classical_music "Indian classical music"), and the [Five Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Classics "Five Classics") of [Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism "Confucianism") laid the basis for subsequent [Chinese music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_music "Chinese music"). Following the rapid [spread of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_of_Islam "Spread of Islam") in the 7th century, [Islamic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_music "Islamic music") dominated Persia and the Arab world, and the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age") saw the presence of numerous important music theorists. Music written for and by the [early Christian Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christian_Church "Early Christian Church") properly inaugurates the [Western classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_classical_music "Western classical music") tradition, which continues into [medieval music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_music "Medieval music") where [polyphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony "Polyphony"), [staff notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_notation "Staff notation") and nascent forms of many modern instruments developed. In addition to religion or the lack thereof, a society's music is influenced by all other aspects of its culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology. Many cultures have coupled music with other art forms, such as the Chinese [four arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_arts "Four arts") and the medieval _[quadrivium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium "Quadrivium")_. The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward [musicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician "Musician") and [composers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer "Composer") all vary between regions and periods. Many cultures have or continue to distinguish between [art music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_music "Art music") (or 'classical music'), [folk music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music"), and [popular music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music "Popular music").
