## Intro



## Financial Statements
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement

**Financial statements** (or **financial reports**) are formal records of the financial activities and position of a business, person, or other entity.

Relevant financial information is presented in a structured manner and in a form which is easy to understand. They typically include four basic financial statements accompanied by a management discussion and analysis:
1. A [balance sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet "Balance sheet") reports on a company's [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset "Asset"), [liabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_\(financial_accounting\) "Liability (financial accounting)"), and [owners equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_\(finance\) "Equity (finance)") at a given point in time.
2. An [income statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_statement "Income statement") reports on a company's [income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income "Income"), [expenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expense "Expense"), and [profits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_\(accounting\) "Profit (accounting)") over a stated period. A profit and loss statement provides information on the operation of the enterprise. These include sales and the various expenses incurred during the stated period.
3. A [statement of changes in equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_changes_in_equity "Statement of changes in equity") reports on the changes in [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_\(finance\) "Equity (finance)") of the company over a stated period.
4. A [cash flow statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow_statement "Cash flow statement") reports on a company's [cash flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow "Cash flow") activities, particularly its operating, [investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investing "Investing") and [financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financing "Financing") activities over a stated period.

Notably, a balance sheet represents a snapshot in time, whereas the income statement, the statement of changes in equity, and the cash flow statement each represent activities over an [accounting period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_period "Accounting period"). By understanding the key functional statements within the balance sheet, business owners and [financial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial "Financial") professionals can make informed decisions that drive growth and stability.


### Purpose of Financial Statements
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement

"The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance and changes in financial position of an enterprise that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions." Financial statements should be understandable, relevant, reliable and comparable. Reported assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses are directly related to an organization's financial position.

Financial statements are intended to be understandable by readers who have "a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and accounting and who are willing to study the information diligently." Financial statements may be used by users for different purposes:
- Owners and managers require financial statements to make important business decisions that affect its continued operations. [Financial analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analysis "Financial analysis") is then performed on these statements to provide management with a more detailed understanding of the figures. These statements are also used as part of management's annual report to the [stockholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder "Shareholder").
- Employees also need these reports in making [collective bargaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining "Collective bargaining") agreements (CBA) with the management, in the case of [labor unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions "Labor unions") or for individuals in discussing their compensation, promotion and rankings.
- Prospective [investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor "Investor") make use of financial statements to assess the viability of investing in a business. Financial analyses are often used by investors and are prepared by professionals (financial analysts), thus providing them with the basis for making investment decisions.
- Financial institutions (banks and other lending companies) use them to decide whether to grant a company with fresh [working capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_capital "Working capital") or extend debt [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_\(finance\) "Security (finance)") (such as a long-term [bank loan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_loan "Bank loan") or [debentures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debenture "Debenture")) to finance expansion and other significant expenditures.
- Stockholders may from time to time request [insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_transparency "Corporate transparency") into how [share capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_capital "Share capital") is managed, which may be made available via financial statements (or [stock statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_statement "Stock statement")), as it lies in the financial interest of shareowners in affirming that capital stock is handled viably and mindfully with duly care.
