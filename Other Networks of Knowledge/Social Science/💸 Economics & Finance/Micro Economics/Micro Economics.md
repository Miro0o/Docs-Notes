## Intro



## Financial statements
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement

**Financial statements** (or **financial reports**) are formal records of the financial activities and position of a business, person, or other entity.

Relevant financial information is presented in a structured manner and in a form which is easy to understand. They typically include four basic financial statements accompanied by a management discussion and analysis:
1. A [balance sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet "Balance sheet") reports on a company's [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset "Asset"), [liabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_\(financial_accounting\) "Liability (financial accounting)"), and [owners equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_\(finance\) "Equity (finance)") at a given point in time.
2. An [income statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_statement "Income statement") reports on a company's [income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income "Income"), [expenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expense "Expense"), and [profits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_\(accounting\) "Profit (accounting)") over a stated period. A profit and loss statement provides information on the operation of the enterprise. These include sales and the various expenses incurred during the stated period.
3. A [statement of changes in equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_of_changes_in_equity "Statement of changes in equity") reports on the changes in [equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_\(finance\) "Equity (finance)") of the company over a stated period.
4. A [cash flow statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow_statement "Cash flow statement") reports on a company's [cash flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow "Cash flow") activities, particularly its operating, [investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investing "Investing") and [financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financing "Financing") activities over a stated period.

Notably, a balance sheet represents a snapshot in time, whereas the income statement, the statement of changes in equity, and the cash flow statement each represent activities over an [accounting period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_period "Accounting period"). By understanding the key functional statements within the balance sheet, business owners and [financial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial "Financial") professionals can make informed decisions that drive growth and stability.
