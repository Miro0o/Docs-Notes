The **Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR**), commonly known as the **Soviet Union**, was a [transcontinental country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_transcontinental_countries#Since_1700 "List of former transcontinental countries") that spanned much of [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia "Eurasia") from 1922 until [its dissolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") in 1991. During its existence, it was the [largest country by area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area "List of countries and dependencies by area"), extending across [eleven time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Russia "Time in Russia") and sharing [borders with twelve countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_the_Soviet_Union#Borders_and_neighbors "Geography of the Soviet Union"), and the [third-most populous country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population "List of countries and dependencies by population"). An overall successor to the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), it was nominally organized as a [federal union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_union "Federal union") of [national republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union "Republics of the Soviet Union"), the largest and most populous of which was the [Russian SFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_SFSR "Russian SFSR"). In practice, [its government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union "Government of the Soviet Union") and [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union "Economy of the Soviet Union") were [highly centralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet-type_economic_planning "Soviet-type economic planning"). As a [one-party state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state "One-party state") governed by the [Communist Party of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union") (CPSU), it was the flagship [communist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state"). Its capital and largest city was [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow "Moscow").

The Soviet Union's roots lay in the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution") of 1917. The new government, led by [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin"), established the Russian SFSR, the world's first constitutionally [communist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state"). The revolution was not accepted by all within the [Russian Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Republic "Russian Republic"), resulting in the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War "Russian Civil War"). The Russian SFSR and its subordinate republics were [merged into the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Creation_of_the_Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics "Treaty on the Creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics") in 1922. Following [Lenin's death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin%27s_death "Lenin's death") in 1924, [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") came to power, inaugurating [rapid industrialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialization_in_the_Soviet_Union "Industrialization in the Soviet Union") and [forced collectivization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union "Collectivization in the Soviet Union") that led to significant economic growth but contributed to a [famine between 1930 and 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_famine_of_1930%E2%80%931933 "Soviet famine of 1930–1933") that killed millions. The [Soviet forced labour camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labor_in_the_Soviet_Union "Forced labor in the Soviet Union") system of the [Gulag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag "Gulag") was expanded. During the late 1930s, Stalin's government conducted the [Great Purge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge "Great Purge") to remove opponents, resulting in large scale deportations, arrests, and show trials accompanied by public fear. Having failed to build an anti-Nazi coalition in Europe, the Soviet Union signed [a non-aggression pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact "Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact") with [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany") in 1939. Despite this, in 1941 Germany [invaded the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invaded_the_Soviet_Union "Invaded the Soviet Union") in the largest land invasion in history, opening the [Eastern Front of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_of_World_War_II "Eastern Front of World War II"). The Soviets played a decisive role in defeating the [Axis powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers") while liberating much of [Central and Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe "Central and Eastern Europe"). However they would suffer an estimated [27 million casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties_of_the_Soviet_Union "World War II casualties of the Soviet Union"), which accounted for most losses among the victorious [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II"). In the [aftermath of the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_II "Aftermath of World War II"), the Soviet Union consolidated the territory occupied by the [Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army"), forming [satellite states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_satellite_states "Soviet satellite states"), and undertook rapid economic development which cemented its status as a [superpower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower "Superpower").

Geopolitical tensions with the United States led to the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"). The American-led [Western Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bloc "Western Bloc") coalesced into [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") in 1949, prompting the Soviet Union to form its own military alliance, the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact "Warsaw Pact"), in 1955. Neither side engaged in direct military confrontation, and instead fought [on an ideological basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_imperialism "Cultural imperialism") and through [proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war "Proxy war"). In 1953, following [Stalin's death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin%27s_death "Stalin's death"), the Soviet Union undertook a campaign of [de-Stalinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Stalinization "De-Stalinization") under [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev "Nikita Khrushchev"), which saw reversals and rejections of Stalinist policies. This campaign caused ideological tensions with the [PRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRC "PRC") led by [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong"), culminating in the acrimonious [Sino-Soviet split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split "Sino-Soviet split"). During the 1950s, the Soviet Union expanded [its efforts in space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_program "Soviet space program") and took a lead in the [Space Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race "Space Race") with the [first artificial satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_artificial_satellite "First artificial satellite"), the [first human spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_human_spaceflight "First human spaceflight"), the [first space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_1 "Salyut 1"), and the [first probe to land on another planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_7 "Venera 7"). In 1985, the last Soviet leader, [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev"), sought to reform the country through his policies of _[glasnost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost "Glasnost")_ and _[perestroika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika "Perestroika")_. In 1989, various countries of the Warsaw Pact [overthrew their Soviet-backed regimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989"), leading to the fall of the Eastern Bloc. A major wave of [nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist "Nationalist") and [separatist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatist "Separatist") movements erupted across the Soviet Union, primarily in [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan"), [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_\(country\) "Georgia (country)") and the [Baltic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_states "Baltic states"). In 1991, amid efforts to [preserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_Union_referendum "1991 Soviet Union referendum") the country as a [renewed federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Union_Treaty "New Union Treaty"), an attempted [coup against Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_attempt "1991 Soviet coup attempt") by hardline communists prompted the largest republics—Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus—to secede. On 26 December, Gorbachev officially recognized the [dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"). [Boris Yeltsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin "Boris Yeltsin"), the leader of the [Russian SFSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic"), oversaw its reconstitution into the [Russian Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation "Russian Federation"), which [became](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_of_states#Soviet_Union "Succession of states") the Soviet Union's successor state; all other republics emerged as fully independent [post-Soviet states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states "Post-Soviet states"). The [Commonwealth of Independent States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States "Commonwealth of Independent States") was formed in the aftermath of the disastrous Soviet collapse, although the Baltics would never join.

During its existence, the Soviet Union produced [many significant social and technological achievements and innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Soviet_innovation "Timeline of Soviet innovation"). The USSR was one of the most advanced industrial states during its existence. It [had the world's second-largest economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_\(nominal\) "List of countries by past and projected GDP (nominal)") and largest standing military. As a [nuclear state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_state "Nuclear state"), it wielded the [largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction "Russia and weapons of mass destruction"). As an Allied nation, it was a [founding member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations "Member states of the United Nations") of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") as well as one of the [five permanent members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council "Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council") of the [United Nations Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council"). Before its dissolution, the Soviet Union was one of the world's two superpowers through its hegemony in Eastern Europe and Asia, global diplomacy, ideological influence (particularly in the [Global South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_South "Global South")), military might, economic strengths, and [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_the_Soviet_Union "Science and technology in the Soviet Union") accomplishments.
