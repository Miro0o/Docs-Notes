## Intro
> 🔗 https://philosophy.hku.hk/think/logic/whatislogic.php

The term "logic" came from the Greek word _logos_, which is sometimes translated as "sentence", "discourse", "reason", "rule", and "ratio". Of course, these translations are not enough to help us understand the more specialized meaning of "logic" as it is used today.

So what is logic? Briefly speaking, ==we might define logic as the study of the principles of correct reasoning==. This is a rough definition, because how logic should be properly defined is actually quite a controversial matter. However, for the purpose of this tour, we thought it would be useful to give you at least some rough idea as to the subject matter that you will be studying. So this is what we shall try to do on this page.

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic

==**Logic** is the study of correct [reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning "Logical reasoning")==. It includes both [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#Formal_logic) and [informal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_logic "Informal logic"). Formal logic is the study of [deductively valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_\(logic\) "Validity (logic)") inferences or [logical truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth "Logical truth"). It examines how conclusions follow from [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise") based on the structure of arguments alone, independent of their topic and content. Informal logic is associated with [informal fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacies "Informal fallacies"), [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking "Critical thinking"), and [argumentation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory "Argumentation theory"). Informal logic examines arguments expressed in [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") whereas formal logic uses [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language"). When used as a [countable noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_noun "Countable noun"), the term "a logic" refers to a specific logical [formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system") that articulates a [proof system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_system "Proof system"). Logic plays a central role in many fields, such as [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics").

Logic studies **arguments**, which consist of a set of **premises** that leads to a **conclusion**. An example is the argument from the premises "it's Sunday" and "if it's Sunday then I don't have to work" leading to the conclusion "I don't have to work." Premises and conclusions express [propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition") or claims that can be true or false. An important feature of propositions is their internal structure. For example, complex propositions are made up of simpler propositions linked by [logical vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective "Logical connective") like ∧ ([and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction")) or → ([if...then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional "Material conditional")). Simple propositions also have parts, like "Sunday" or "work" in the example. The truth of a proposition usually depends on the meanings of all of its parts. However, this is not the case for logically true propositions. They are true only because of their logical structure independent of the specific meanings of the individual parts.

Arguments can be either correct or incorrect. An argument is correct if its premises support its conclusion. [Deductive arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning") have the strongest form of support: if their premises are true then their conclusion must also be true. This is not the case for [ampliative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampliative "Ampliative") arguments, which arrive at genuinely new information not found in the premises. Many arguments in everyday discourse and the sciences are ampliative arguments. They are divided into [inductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning") and [abductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning") arguments. Inductive arguments are statistical generalizations, such as inferring that all ravens are black based on many individual observations of black ravens. Abductive arguments are [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference") to the best explanation, for example, when a doctor concludes that a patient has a certain disease which explains the symptoms they suffer. Arguments that fall short of the standards of correct reasoning often embody [fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies "Fallacies"). Systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the correctness of arguments.

Logic has been studied since [antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history "Ancient history"). Early approaches include [Aristotelian logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_logic "Aristotelian logic"), [Stoic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_logic "Stoic logic"), [Nyaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaya "Nyaya"), and [Mohism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohism "Mohism"). Aristotelian logic focuses on reasoning in the form of [syllogisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism"). It was considered the main system of logic in the Western world until it was replaced by modern formal logic, which has its roots in the work of late 19th-century mathematicians such as [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege"). Today, the most commonly used system is [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic "Classical logic"). It consists of [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") and [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"). Propositional logic only considers logical relations between full propositions. First-order logic also takes the internal parts of propositions into account, like [predicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_\(mathematical_logic\) "Predicate (mathematical logic)") and [quantifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifier_\(logic\) "Quantifier (logic)"). Extended logics accept the basic intuitions behind classical logic and apply it to other fields, such as [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"), and [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"). Deviant logics, on the other hand, reject certain classical intuitions and provide alternative explanations of the basic laws of logic.

### Formal Logic and Informal Logic 🆚 Mathematical Logic and Critical Thinking
#formal_logic #mathematical_logic #informal_logic

> 🔗 https://philosophy.hku.hk/think/logic/whatislogic.php

Sometimes a distinction is made between _informal logic_ and _formal logic_. The term "informal logic" is often used to mean the same thing as critical thinking. Sometimes it is used to refer to the study of reasoning and fallacies in the context of everyday life. "Formal logic" is mainly concerned with formal systems of logic. These are specially constructed systems for carrying out proofs, where the languages and rules of reasoning are precisely and carefully defined. _Sentential logic_ (also known as "Propositional logic") and _Predicate Logic_ are both examples of formal systems of logic.

There are many reasons for studying formal logic. One is that formal logic helps us identify patterns of good reasoning and patterns of bad reasoning, so we know which to follow and which to avoid. This is why studying basic formal logic can help improve critical thinking. Formal systems of logic are also used by linguists to study natural languages. Computer scientists also employ formal systems of logic in research relating to Artificial Intelligence. Finally, many philosophers also like to use formal logic when dealing with complicated philosophical problems, in order to make their reasoning more explicit and precise.

#### 👉 Critical Thinking (Informal Logic)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking

**Critical thinking** is the process of analyzing available [facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact "Fact"), [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence "Evidence"), [observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation "Observation"), and [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") to make sound conclusions or informed choices. It involves recognizing underlying assumptions, providing justifications for ideas and actions, evaluating these justifications through comparisons with varying perspectives, and assessing their rationality and potential consequences. The goal of critical thinking is to form a [judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment "Judgment") through the application of [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational "Rational"), [skeptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism "Skepticism"), and [unbiased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias "Bias") analyses and evaluation. In modern times, the use of the phrase _critical thinking_ can be traced to [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey"), who used the phrase _reflective thinking,_ which depends on the knowledge base of an individual; the excellence of critical thinking in which an individual can engage varies according to it. According to philosopher Richard W. Paul, critical thinking and analysis are competencies that can be learned or trained. The application of critical thinking includes [self-directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-directedness "Self-directedness"), [self-disciplined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline "Discipline"), [self-monitored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-monitoring "Self-monitoring"), and self-[corrective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_feedback "Corrective feedback") habits of the mind, as critical thinking is not a natural process; it must be induced, and ownership of the process must be taken for successful questioning and reasoning. Critical thinking presupposes a rigorous commitment to overcome [egocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentrism "Egocentrism") and [sociocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocentrism "Sociocentrism"), that leads to a mindful command of effective communication and [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving").


### Soundness & Completeness
> ↗ [Mathematical Logic /Soundness & Compelteness](../../../../🧮%20Mathematics/🤼‍♀️%20Mathematical%20Logic/Mathematical%20Logic.md#Soundness%20&%20Completeness)

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness

In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning"), an [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") is **sound** if it is both [valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_\(logic\) "Validity (logic)") in form and has no false [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise"). Soundness has a related meaning in [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), wherein a [formal system of logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system") is sound [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") every [well-formed formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula "Well-formed formula") that can be proven in the system is logically valid with respect to the [logical semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_of_logic "Semantics of logic") of the system.
