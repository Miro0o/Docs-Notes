The term "logic" came from the Greek word _logos_, which is sometimes translated as "sentence", "discourse", "reason", "rule", and "ratio". Of course, these translations are not enough to help us understand the more specialized meaning of "logic" as it is used today.

So what is logic? Briefly speaking, ==we might define logic as the study of the principles of correct reasoning==. This is a rough definition, because how logic should be properly defined is actually quite a controversial matter. However, for the purpose of this tour, we thought it would be useful to give you at least some rough idea as to the subject matter that you will be studying. So this is what we shall try to do on this page.

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic

==**Logic** is the study of correct [reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning "Logical reasoning")==. It includes both [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#Formal_logic) and [informal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_logic "Informal logic"). Formal logic is the study of [deductively valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_\(logic\) "Validity (logic)") inferences or [logical truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_truth "Logical truth"). It examines how conclusions follow from [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise") based on the structure of arguments alone, independent of their topic and content. Informal logic is associated with [informal fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacies "Informal fallacies"), [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking "Critical thinking"), and [argumentation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory "Argumentation theory"). Informal logic examines arguments expressed in [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") whereas formal logic uses [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language"). When used as a [countable noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_noun "Countable noun"), the term "a logic" refers to a specific logical [formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system") that articulates a [proof system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_system "Proof system"). Logic plays a central role in many fields, such as [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics").

Logic studies **arguments**, which consist of a set of **premises** that leads to a **conclusion**. An example is the argument from the premises "it's Sunday" and "if it's Sunday then I don't have to work" leading to the conclusion "I don't have to work." Premises and conclusions express [propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition") or claims that can be true or false. An important feature of propositions is their internal structure. For example, complex propositions are made up of simpler propositions linked by [logical vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective "Logical connective") like ∧ ([and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction")) or → ([if...then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional "Material conditional")). Simple propositions also have parts, like "Sunday" or "work" in the example. The truth of a proposition usually depends on the meanings of all of its parts. However, this is not the case for logically true propositions. They are true only because of their logical structure independent of the specific meanings of the individual parts.

Arguments can be either correct or incorrect. An argument is correct if its premises support its conclusion. [Deductive arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning") have the strongest form of support: if their premises are true then their conclusion must also be true. This is not the case for [ampliative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampliative "Ampliative") arguments, which arrive at genuinely new information not found in the premises. Many arguments in everyday discourse and the sciences are ampliative arguments. They are divided into [inductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning") and [abductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning") arguments. Inductive arguments are statistical generalizations, such as inferring that all ravens are black based on many individual observations of black ravens. Abductive arguments are [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference") to the best explanation, for example, when a doctor concludes that a patient has a certain disease which explains the symptoms they suffer. Arguments that fall short of the standards of correct reasoning often embody [fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies "Fallacies"). Systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the correctness of arguments.

Logic has been studied since [antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history "Ancient history"). Early approaches include [Aristotelian logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_logic "Aristotelian logic"), [Stoic logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoic_logic "Stoic logic"), [Nyaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaya "Nyaya"), and [Mohism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohism "Mohism"). Aristotelian logic focuses on reasoning in the form of [syllogisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism"). It was considered the main system of logic in the Western world until it was replaced by modern formal logic, which has its roots in the work of late 19th-century mathematicians such as [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege"). Today, the most commonly used system is [classical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic "Classical logic"). It consists of [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") and [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"). Propositional logic only considers logical relations between full propositions. First-order logic also takes the internal parts of propositions into account, like [predicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_\(mathematical_logic\) "Predicate (mathematical logic)") and [quantifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifier_\(logic\) "Quantifier (logic)"). Extended logics accept the basic intuitions behind classical logic and apply it to other fields, such as [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"), and [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"). Deviant logics, on the other hand, reject certain classical intuitions and provide alternative explanations of the basic laws of logic.


### Reason and Rationality
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason#

**Reason** is the capacity of [consciously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") applying [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") by [drawing valid conclusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence") from new or existing [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information"), with the aim of seeking [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth"). It is associated with such characteristically [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") activities as [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion"), [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"), and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as [rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality"), although the latter is more about its application.

**Reasoning** involves using more-or-less rational processes of [thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought "Thought") and [cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition "Cognition") to extrapolate from one's existing knowledge to generate new knowledge, and involves the use of one's [intellect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellect "Intellect"). The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use **formal reasoning** to produce [logically valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_\(logic\) "Validity (logic)") [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") and true conclusions. Reasoning may be subdivided into [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_form "Logical form") of [logical reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning "Logical reasoning"), such as [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning"), [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning"), and [abductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning").

[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") drew a distinction between logical **discursive reasoning** (reason proper), and [intuitive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_\(psychology\) "Intuition (psychology)"), in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a [formal proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_proof "Formal proof"), arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.

Reasoning, like [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit "Habit") or [intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition "Intuition"), is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand the significance of sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as [cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality"), [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth") and [falsehood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_\(logic\) "False (logic)"), or [good and evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil "Good and evil"). Reasoning, as a part of [executive decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions "Executive functions"), is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of [goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal "Goal"), [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief "Belief"), [attitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_\(psychology\) "Attitude (psychology)"), [traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tradition "Tradition"), and [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution "Institution"), and therefore with the capacity for [freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom "Freedom") and [self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination "Self-determination").

[Psychologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist "Psychologist") and [cognitive scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science") have attempted to study and explain [how people reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_reasoning "Psychology of reasoning"), e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning "Automated reasoning") studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. [Animal psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_psychology "Comparative psychology") considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.
#### Reason Compared To Logic
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason#Reason_compared_to_logic

The terms _logic_ or _logical_ are sometimes used as if they were identical with _reason_ or _rational_, or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason: "Logic is about reasoning—about going from premises to a conclusion. ... When you do logic, you try to clarify reasoning and separate good from bad reasoning." In modern [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [rational choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory "Rational choice theory") is assumed to equate to logically [consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency") choice.

However, reason and logic can be thought of as distinct—although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author [Douglas Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter "Douglas Hofstadter"), in _[Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach "Gödel, Escher, Bach")_, characterizes the distinction in this way: Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system. Psychologists Mark H. Bickard and Robert L. Campbell argue that "rationality cannot be simply assimilated to logicality"; they note that "human knowledge of logic and [logical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system#Logical_system "Formal system") has developed" over time through reasoning, and logical systems "can't construct new logical systems more powerful than themselves", so reasoning and rationality must involve more than a system of logic. Psychologist David Moshman, citing Bickhard and Campbell, argues for a "[metacognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognitive "Metacognitive") conception of rationality" in which a person's development of reason "involves increasing consciousness and control of logical and other inferences".

Reason is a type of [thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought "Thought"), and [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") involves the attempt to describe a system of formal rules or norms of appropriate reasoning. The oldest surviving Western writings to explicitly consider and systematically codify the rules by which reason operates, are the works of the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher") [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), especially _Prior Analytics_ and _Posterior Analytics_. Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason, Aristotle's [newly coined word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism "Neologism") "[syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism")" (_syllogismos_) identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to "the logical" (_hē logikē_), he was referring more broadly to rational thought.
#### Reason Compared To "Cause-and-Effect" Thinking, and Symbolic Thinking
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason#Reason_compared_to_cause-and-effect_thinking,_and_symbolic_thinking

As pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke, and Hume, some animals are also clearly capable of a type of "[associative thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_\(psychology\) "Association (psychology)")", even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.

Human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas—even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect—perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way that can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of [Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke"), for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of [syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism").

More generally, according to [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce"), reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol"), as well as [indices and icons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotic_elements_and_classes_of_signs_\(Peirce\)#II._Icon,_index,_symbol "Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)"), the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either (for example) smoke or fire. One example of such a system of symbols and signs is [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language").

The connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes") described the creation of "Markes, or Notes of remembrance" as _speech_. He used the word _speech_ as an English version of the Greek word _[logos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos "Logos")_ so that speech did not need to be communicated. When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called "[Signes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_\(linguistics\) "Sign (linguistics)")" by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (_logos_), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and _[nous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous "Nous")_, and even uses the word "_logos_" in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.

基本逻辑方法
- **抽象与概括**：
	- 从大量具体事物中提取共同的本质特征，形成更广泛、普遍的概念。﻿
- **分析与综合**：
	- 分析是将事物分解为部分，研究各部分之间的联系；综合则是将分散的各部分按照其联系整合起来，形成一个整体。﻿
- **归纳与演绎**：
	- 归纳是从个别到一般，根据具体事例推导出普遍性规律；演绎则相反，从普遍性原理出发，推导出个别性的结论。﻿
- **对比（求同、求异）**：
	- 通过比较不同事物之间的相同点（求同）和不同点（求异），以深入理解事物的本质和规律。﻿
- **原因与结果**：
	- 通过分析事物发生的原因和产生的后果，进行正向推理（原因推结果）或逆向推理（结果推原因），以及建立因果链。

其他重要逻辑方法﻿
- **分类法**：
	- 根据事物的特定特征或标准，将事物划分为不同的类别，以便于分析和理解。
- **假设演绎法**：
	- 先提出一个假设，然后通过演绎推理来验证其正确性，若验证失败则修正假设，继续进行。
- **矛盾分析法**：
	- 通过分析矛盾的两个方面，找出最佳的解决方案。
- **系统分析法**：
	- 将研究对象视为一个有机的整体，分析其内部各组成部分及其相互关系。
#### Logical Reasoning
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason#Logical_reasoning_methods_and_argumentation

A subdivision of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") and a variety of reasoning is [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"). The traditional main division made in philosophy is between [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning") and [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning"). [Formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") has been described as _the science of deduction_. The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as [informal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_logic "Informal logic") or [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking "Critical thinking").

An inference is [valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_\(logic\) "Validity (logic)") if its conclusion follows [logically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") from its [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise"), meaning that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, the inference from the premises "all men are mortal" and "[Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") is a man" to the conclusion "Socrates is mortal" is deductively valid. An [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") is _[sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness "Soundness")_ if it is valid _and_ all its premises are true. One approach defines deduction in terms of the intentions of the author: they have to intend for the premises to offer deductive support to the conclusion. With the help of this modification, it is possible to distinguish valid from invalid deductive reasoning: it is invalid if the author's belief about the deductive support is false, but even invalid deductive reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning.

**Deductive logic** studies under what conditions an argument is valid. According to the [semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic "Semantic") approach, an argument is valid if there is no possible [interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_\(logic\) "Interpretation (logic)") of the argument whereby its premises are true and its conclusion is false. The [syntactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic "Syntactic") approach, by contrast, focuses on [rules of inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_inference "Rules of inference"), that is, schemas of drawing a conclusion from a set of premises based only on their [logical form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_form "Logical form"). There are various rules of inference, such as [modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens "Modus ponens") and [modus tollens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens "Modus tollens"). Invalid deductive arguments, which do not follow a rule of inference, are called [formal fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacies "Formal fallacies"). Rules of inference are definitory rules and contrast with strategic rules, which specify what inferences one needs to draw in order to arrive at an intended conclusion.
##### Inductive Logic & Inductive Reasoning ❌
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning

**Inductive reasoning** refers to a variety of [methods of reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_reasoning "Method of reasoning") in which the conclusion of an argument is supported not with deductive certainty, but at best with some degree of probability. Unlike [_deductive_ reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning") (such as [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction")), where the conclusion is _certain_, given the premises are correct, inductive reasoning produces conclusions that are at best _[probable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable "Probable")_, given the evidence provided.
##### Abductive Logic & Abductive Reasoning ❌
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning

**Abductive reasoning** (also called **abduction**, **abductive inference**,1) or **retroduction**) is a form of [logical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_inference "Logical inference") that seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from a set of observations. It was formulated and advanced by American [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher") and [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logician "Logician") [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce") beginning in the latter half of the 19th century.

Abductive reasoning, unlike [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning"), yields a plausible conclusion but does not definitively verify it. Abductive conclusions do not eliminate uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in terms such as "best available" or "most likely". While [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning") draws general conclusions that apply to many situations, abductive conclusions are confined to the particular observations in question.

In the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law, [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") research spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction. Diagnostic [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system "Expert system") frequently employ abduction.

### Formal Logic and Informal Logic 🆚 Mathematical Logic and Critical Thinking

> 🔗 https://philosophy.hku.hk/think/logic/whatislogic.php

Sometimes a distinction is made between _informal logic_ and _formal logic_. The term "informal logic" is often used to mean the same thing as critical thinking. Sometimes it is used to refer to the study of reasoning and fallacies in the context of everyday life. "Formal logic" is mainly concerned with formal systems of logic. These are specially constructed systems for carrying out proofs, where the languages and rules of reasoning are precisely and carefully defined. _Sentential logic_ (also known as "Propositional logic") and _Predicate Logic_ are both examples of formal systems of logic.

There are many reasons for studying formal logic. One is that formal logic helps us identify patterns of good reasoning and patterns of bad reasoning, so we know which to follow and which to avoid. This is why studying basic formal logic can help improve critical thinking. Formal systems of logic are also used by linguists to study natural languages. Computer scientists also employ formal systems of logic in research relating to Artificial Intelligence. Finally, many philosophers also like to use formal logic when dealing with complicated philosophical problems, in order to make their reasoning more explicit and precise.

**Critical thinking** is the process of analyzing available [facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact "Fact"), [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence "Evidence"), [observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation "Observation"), and [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") to make sound conclusions or informed choices. It involves recognizing underlying assumptions, providing justifications for ideas and actions, evaluating these justifications through comparisons with varying perspectives, and assessing their rationality and potential consequences. The goal of critical thinking is to form a [judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment "Judgment") through the application of [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational "Rational"), [skeptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism "Skepticism"), and [unbiased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias "Bias") analyses and evaluation. In modern times, the use of the phrase _critical thinking_ can be traced to [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey"), who used the phrase _reflective thinking,_ which depends on the knowledge base of an individual; the excellence of critical thinking in which an individual can engage varies according to it. According to philosopher Richard W. Paul, critical thinking and analysis are competencies that can be learned or trained. The application of critical thinking includes [self-directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-directedness "Self-directedness"), [self-disciplined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline "Discipline"), [self-monitored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-monitoring "Self-monitoring"), and self-[corrective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_feedback "Corrective feedback") habits of the mind, as critical thinking is not a natural process; it must be induced, and ownership of the process must be taken for successful questioning and reasoning. Critical thinking presupposes a rigorous commitment to overcome [egocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentrism "Egocentrism") and [sociocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocentrism "Sociocentrism"), that leads to a mindful command of effective communication and [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving").

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness

In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning"), an [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") is **sound** if it is both [valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_\(logic\) "Validity (logic)") in form and has no false [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise"). Soundness has a related meaning in [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), wherein a [formal system of logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system") is sound [if and only if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if "If and only if") every [well-formed formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula "Well-formed formula") that can be proven in the system is logically valid with respect to the [logical semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_of_logic "Semantics of logic") of the system.

- 用数学语言来讲，这其实就是一个 y=f(x)。  求x，是溯因；求f，是归纳；求y，是演绎。
- 这个说法只是近似，可以拿来理解，但其实是错误的。因为这方程式里的x、y是充要条件，而推理中，x、y之间只是充分条件。
- 溯因推理和归纳推理，结果都不保真； 演绎推理保真的基础是前提为真
	- 归纳不保真，因为可能存在混杂因素；溯因不保真，因为存在反向推理问题
	- 只有推理演绎是正确的，其他两种得不出真理。其他两种只能证伪不能证实。
