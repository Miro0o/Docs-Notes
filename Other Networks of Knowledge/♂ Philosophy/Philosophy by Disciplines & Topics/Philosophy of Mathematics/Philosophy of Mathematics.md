## Intro

**Philosophy of mathematics** is the branch of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") that deals with the nature of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and its relationship to other areas of philosophy, particularly [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") and [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"). Central questions posed include whether or not mathematical objects are purely abstract entities or are in some way concrete, and in what the relationship such objects have with physical reality consists.

Major themes that are dealt with in philosophy of mathematics include:
- _Reality_: The question is whether mathematics is a pure product of human mind or whether it has some reality by itself.
- _Logic and rigor_
- _Relationship with physical reality_
- _Relationship with science_
- _Relationship with applications_
- _Mathematical truth_
- _Nature as human activity_ ([science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts "The arts"), [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game "Game"), or all together)

If mathematics is regarded as a science, then the philosophy of mathematics can be regarded as a branch of the philosophy of science, next to disciplines such as the philosophy of physics and the philosophy of biology. However, because of its subject matter, the philosophy of mathematics occupies a special place in the philosophy of science. Whereas the natural sciences investigate entities that are located in space and time, it is not at all obvious that this is also the case for the objects that are studied in mathematics. In addition to that, the methods of investigation of mathematics differ markedly from the methods of investigation in the natural sciences. Whereas the latter acquire general knowledge using inductive methods, mathematical knowledge appears to be acquired in a different way: ==by deduction from basic principles==. The status of mathematical knowledge also appears to differ from the status of knowledge in the natural sciences. The theories of the natural sciences appear to be less certain and more open to revision than mathematical theories. For these reasons mathematics poses problems of a quite distinctive kind for philosophy. Therefore philosophers have accorded special attention to ontological and epistemological questions concerning mathematics.
