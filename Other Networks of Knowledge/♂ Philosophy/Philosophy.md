## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy

==**Philosophy** is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence "Existence"), [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason"), [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"), [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_\(ethics_and_social_sciences\) "Value (ethics and social sciences)"), [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind"), and [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"). It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its methods and assumptions.==

Historically, many of the individual [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), such as [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), formed part of philosophy. However, they are considered separate academic disciplines in the modern sense of the term. **Influential traditions in the [history of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_philosophy "History of philosophy") include [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy "Western philosophy"), [Arabic–Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_philosophy "Islamic philosophy"), [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy "Indian philosophy"), and [Chinese philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy "Chinese philosophy").** Western philosophy originated in [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") and covers a wide area of philosophical subfields. A central topic in Arabic–Persian philosophy is the relation between reason and [revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation "Revelation"). Indian philosophy combines the [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality") problem of how to reach [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism "Enlightenment in Buddhism") with the exploration of the nature of reality and the ways of arriving at knowledge. Chinese philosophy focuses principally on practical issues about right social conduct, government, and [self-cultivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-cultivation "Self-cultivation").

Major branches of philosophy are [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), and [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"). Epistemology studies what knowledge is and how to acquire it. Ethics investigates moral principles and what constitutes right conduct. Logic is the study of [correct reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning "Logical reasoning") and explores how good [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") can be distinguished from bad ones. Metaphysics examines the most general features of [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality"), existence, [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_\(philosophy\) "Object (philosophy)"), and [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_\(philosophy\) "Property (philosophy)"). Other subfields are [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"), [philosophy of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language "Philosophy of language"), [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind"), [philosophy of religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_religion "Philosophy of religion"), [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science"), [philosophy of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics "Philosophy of mathematics"), [philosophy of history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_history "Philosophy of history"), and [political philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy"). Within each branch, there are competing [schools of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_philosophy "Schools of philosophy") that promote different principles, theories, or methods.

Philosophers use a great variety of methods to arrive at philosophical knowledge. They include [conceptual analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_analysis "Conceptual analysis"), reliance on [common sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense "Common sense") and [intuitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition "Intuition"), use of [thought experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiments "Thought experiments"), analysis of [ordinary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_language "Ordinary language"), [description of experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_\(philosophy\) "Phenomenology (philosophy)"), and [critical questioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning "Socratic questioning"). Philosophy is related to many other fields, including the sciences, [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business "Business"), [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law"), and [journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism "Journalism"). It provides an [interdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinary "Interdisciplinary") perspective and studies the scope and fundamental concepts of these fields. It also investigates their methods and ethical implications.
