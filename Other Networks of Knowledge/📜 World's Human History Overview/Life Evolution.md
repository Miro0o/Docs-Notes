The Tree of Life shows how all life on Earth is related. In our interactive tree of life you can explore the relationships between¬†**2,235,473**¬†species and wonder at¬†**105,463**¬†images on a single zoomable page. Each leaf represents a different species, and the branches illustrate how these many species evolved from common ancestors over billions of years. Explore the relationships between species, learn about their common ancestors, or embark on a guided tour around the tree. Zoom around the tree to be amazed by the diversity of life on Earth.
