## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy

==**Philosophy** is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning topics like [existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence "Existence"), [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason"), [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"), [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_\(ethics_and_social_sciences\) "Value (ethics and social sciences)"), [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind"), and [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"). It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its methods and assumptions.==

Historically, many of the individual [sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), such as [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), formed part of philosophy. However, they are considered separate academic disciplines in the modern sense of the term. **Influential traditions in the [history of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_philosophy "History of philosophy") include [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy "Western philosophy"), [Arabic–Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_philosophy "Islamic philosophy"), [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy "Indian philosophy"), and [Chinese philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy "Chinese philosophy").** Western philosophy originated in [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") and covers a wide area of philosophical subfields. A central topic in Arabic–Persian philosophy is the relation between reason and [revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation "Revelation"). Indian philosophy combines the [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality") problem of how to reach [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism "Enlightenment in Buddhism") with the exploration of the nature of reality and the ways of arriving at knowledge. Chinese philosophy focuses principally on practical issues about right social conduct, government, and [self-cultivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-cultivation "Self-cultivation").

Major branches of philosophy are [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), and [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"). Epistemology studies what knowledge is and how to acquire it. Ethics investigates moral principles and what constitutes right conduct. Logic is the study of [correct reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_reasoning "Logical reasoning") and explores how good [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Argument") can be distinguished from bad ones. Metaphysics examines the most general features of [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality"), existence, [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_\(philosophy\) "Object (philosophy)"), and [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_\(philosophy\) "Property (philosophy)"). Other subfields are [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"), [philosophy of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language "Philosophy of language"), [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind"), [philosophy of religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_religion "Philosophy of religion"), [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science"), [philosophy of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics "Philosophy of mathematics"), [philosophy of history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_history "Philosophy of history"), and [political philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy"). Within each branch, there are competing [schools of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_philosophy "Schools of philosophy") that promote different principles, theories, or methods.

Philosophers use a great variety of methods to arrive at philosophical knowledge. They include [conceptual analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_analysis "Conceptual analysis"), reliance on [common sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense "Common sense") and [intuitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition "Intuition"), use of [thought experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiments "Thought experiments"), analysis of [ordinary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_language "Ordinary language"), [description of experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_\(philosophy\) "Phenomenology (philosophy)"), and [critical questioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning "Socratic questioning"). Philosophy is related to many other fields, including the sciences, [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business "Business"), [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law"), and [journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism "Journalism"). It provides an [interdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinary "Interdisciplinary") perspective and studies the scope and fundamental concepts of these fields. It also investigates their methods and ethical implications.

## History of Philosophy & World's  Major Philosophical Thoughts

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_philosophy

The **history of philosophy** is the systematic study of the development of [philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") thought. It focuses on philosophy as rational inquiry based on argumentation, but some theorists also include [myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth "Myth"), [religious traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion"), and proverbial lore.

[Western philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy "Western philosophy") originated with an [inquiry into the fundamental nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") of the cosmos in [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"). Subsequent philosophical developments covered a wide range of topics including the nature of [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality") and the [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind"), [how people should act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"), and [how to arrive at knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"). The [medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval "Medieval") period was focused more on [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"). The [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") period saw a renewed interest in [Ancient Greek philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy "Ancient Greek philosophy") and the emergence of [humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism "Renaissance humanism"). The modern period was characterized by an increased focus on how philosophical and scientific knowledge is created. Its new ideas were used during the [Enlightenment period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") to challenge traditional authorities. Influential developments in the 19th and 20th centuries included [German idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealism "German idealism"), [pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism "Pragmatism"), [positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism "Positivism"), [formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_logic "Formal logic"), linguistic analysis, [phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_\(philosophy\) "Phenomenology (philosophy)"), [existentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism "Existentialism"), and [postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism "Postmodernism").

[Arabic–Persian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_philosophy "Islamic philosophy") was strongly influenced by Ancient Greek philosophers. It had its peak period during the [Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age"). One of its key topics was the relation between reason and revelation as two compatible ways of arriving at the truth. [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna") developed a comprehensive philosophical system that synthesized Islamic faith and Greek philosophy. After the Islamic Golden Age, the influence of philosophical inquiry waned, partly due to [Al-Ghazali's critique of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Philosophers "The Incoherence of the Philosophers"). In the 17th century, [Mulla Sadra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulla_Sadra "Mulla Sadra") developed a metaphysical system based on mysticism. [Islamic modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_modernism "Islamic modernism") emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries as an attempt to reconcile traditional Islamic doctrines with [modernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity "Modernity").

[Indian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy "Indian philosophy") is characterized by its combined interest in the nature of reality, the ways of arriving at knowledge, and the [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality") question of how to reach [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism "Enlightenment in Buddhism"). Its roots are in the religious scriptures known as the [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas"). Subsequent Indian philosophy is often divided into [orthodox schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80stika_and_n%C4%81stika "Āstika and nāstika"), which are closely associated with the teachings of the Vedas, and heterodox schools, like [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism") and [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism "Jainism"). Influential schools based on them include the Hindu schools of [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta "Advaita Vedanta") and [Navya-Nyāya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navya-Ny%C4%81ya "Navya-Nyāya") as well as the Buddhist schools of [Madhyamaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhyamaka "Madhyamaka") and [Yogācāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yog%C4%81c%C4%81ra "Yogācāra"). In the modern period, the exchange between Indian and Western thought led various Indian philosophers to develop comprehensive systems. They aimed to unite and harmonize diverse philosophical and religious schools of thought.

Central topics in [Chinese philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy "Chinese philosophy") were right social conduct, government, and [self-cultivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-cultivation "Self-cultivation"). In early Chinese philosophy, [Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism "Confucianism") explored moral [virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue "Virtue") and how they lead to harmony in society while [Daoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoism "Daoism") focused on the relation between humans and nature. Later developments include the introduction and transformation of [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist "Buddhist") teachings and the emergence of the schools of [Xuanxue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuanxue "Xuanxue") and [Neo-Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Confucianism "Neo-Confucianism"). The modern period in Chinese philosophy was characterized by its encounter with Western philosophy, specifically with [Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism"). Other influential traditions in the history of philosophy were [Japanese philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_philosophy "Japanese philosophy"), [Latin American philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_philosophy "Latin American philosophy"), and [African philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_philosophy "African philosophy").

首先感谢小破站“npc张青登”团队的这个项目
本人非哲学系，之前读过一点费希特，但太不说人话了，其实主要是翻译的问题，都太老了。然后转头去看谢林也很吃力，于是一直搁置。现在有了这个东西不得不说太方便了，读了几十页目前感觉没有什么太大的问题，甚至可以直接去读德语原文了（不嫌每一句都要翻译麻烦的话），从这点来说，以后限制普罗大众学习哲学的也许只有懒惰了， ai理解概括文本的能力太强了：
The outgoing, by nature infinite activity is the objective in the self; the self-reverting activity is nothing else but the striving to intuit oneself in that infinitude.
严谨版本：
"本质上具有无限性的外向活动是自我本身的对象；自我回返的活动不过是试图在无限性中直观自身。"
通俗版本：
"人总是不断向外探索的无限行为，这就是自我追求的目标；而自我反思的行为，其实就是想在无限中理解自己。"
语法结构分析：
主句结构：两个并列分句通过分号连接
第一分句：
主语：The outgoing, by nature infinite activity（具有自然无限性的外向活动）
系动词：is
表语：the objective in the self（自我中的目标）
第二分句：
主语：the self-reverting activity（自我回返的活动）
系动词：is
表语：nothing else but the striving to intuit oneself in that infinitude（不过是试图在无限中直观自身的努力）
其中"striving to intuit"为动名词短语作表语，"in that infinitude"为介词短语作状语
注：该句使用了哲学文本中常见的抽象表达方式，通过对比"outgoing"（外向）与"self-reverting"（自我回返）的辩证关系，阐述了自我认知的两种基本运动形式。
