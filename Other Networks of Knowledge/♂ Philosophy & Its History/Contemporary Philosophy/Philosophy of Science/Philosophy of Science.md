## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science#Introduction

**Philosophy of science** is the branch of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") concerned with the foundations, [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology "Methodology"), and implications of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"). Amongst its central questions are [the difference between science and non-science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem "Demarcation problem"), the [reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliabilism "Reliabilism") of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose and meaning of science as a human endeavour. Philosophy of science focuses on [metaphysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), [epistemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") and [semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics "Semantics") aspects of scientific practice, and overlaps with [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology"), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), and [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"), for example, when it explores the relationship between science and the concept of [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth"). Philosophy of science is both a theoretical and [empirical discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research "Empirical research"), relying on philosophical theorising as well as [meta-studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatheory "Metatheory") of scientific practice. Ethical issues such as [bioethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioethics "Bioethics") and [scientific misconduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct "Scientific misconduct") are often considered [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics") or [science studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_studies "Science studies") rather than the philosophy of science.

Many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science lack contemporary consensus, including whether science can infer [truth about unobservable entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_realism "Scientific realism") and [whether inductive reasoning can be justified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction "Problem of induction") as yielding definite scientific knowledge. Philosophers of science also consider philosophical problems within particular sciences (such as [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_biology "Philosophy of biology"), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_physics "Philosophy of physics") and social sciences such as [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") and [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology")). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about [philosophy itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphilosophy "Metaphilosophy").

While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"), the general philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century following the [logical positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivist "Logical positivist") movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper "Karl Popper") criticized logical positivism and helped establish a modern set of standards for [scientific methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method"). [Thomas Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn "Thomas Kuhn")'s 1962 book _[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions")_ was also formative, challenging the view of [scientific progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_progress "Scientific progress") as the steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a "[paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm "Paradigm")", the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.

Subsequently, the [coherentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherentism "Coherentism") approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to [W. V. Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine "Willard Van Orman Quine") and others. Some thinkers such as [Stephen Jay Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould "Stephen Jay Gould") seek to ground science in [axiomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic "Axiomatic") assumptions, such as the [uniformity of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformity_of_nature "Uniformity of nature"). A vocal minority of philosophers, and [Paul Feyerabend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend "Paul Feyerabend") in particular, argue against the existence of the "[scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method")", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly [supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural "Supernatural") ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how [knowledge is created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivist_epistemology "Constructivist epistemology") from a [sociological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology") perspective, an approach represented by scholars like [David Bloor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bloor "David Bloor") and [Barry Barnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Barry_Barnes "S. Barry Barnes"). Finally, a tradition in [continental philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_philosophy "Continental philosophy") approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.

Philosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_space_and_time "Philosophy of space and time") raised by Einstein's [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), to the implications of [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_and_economics "Philosophy and economics") for [public policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy "Public policy"). A central theme is whether the terms of one scientific theory can be intra- or intertheoretically [reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism "Reductionism") to the terms of another. Can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_psychology "Philosophy of psychology")? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the [foundations of statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_statistics "Foundations of statistics"). The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the [philosophy of medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_medicine "Philosophy of medicine"). Additionally, the philosophies of biology, psychology, and the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_social_science "Philosophy of social science") explore whether the scientific studies of [human nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature") can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_\(personal_and_cultural\) "Value (personal and cultural)") and by social relations.
