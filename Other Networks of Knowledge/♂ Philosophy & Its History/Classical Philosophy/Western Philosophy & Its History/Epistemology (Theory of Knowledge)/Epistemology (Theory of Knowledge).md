**Epistemology** is the branch of [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") that examines the nature, origin, and limits of [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"). Also called the **theory of knowledge**, it explores different types of knowledge, such as [propositional knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_knowledge "Propositional knowledge") about facts, [practical knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_knowledge "Practical knowledge") in the form of skills, and [knowledge by acquaintance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_by_acquaintance "Knowledge by acquaintance") as a familiarity through experience. Epistemologists study the concepts of [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief "Belief"), [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth"), and [justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_\(epistemology\) "Justification (epistemology)") to understand the nature of knowledge. To discover how knowledge arises, they investigate sources of justification, such as [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception"), [introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection "Introspection"), [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory"), [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason"), and [testimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimony "Testimony").

The school of [skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism "Philosophical skepticism") questions the human ability to attain knowledge, while [fallibilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism "Fallibilism") says that knowledge is never certain. [Empiricists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") hold that all knowledge comes from sense experience, whereas [rationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism") believe that some knowledge does not depend on it. [Coherentists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherentism "Coherentism") argue that a belief is justified if it coheres with other beliefs. [Foundationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundationalism "Foundationalism"), by contrast, maintain that the justification of basic beliefs does not depend on other beliefs. [Internalism and externalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalism_and_externalism "Internalism and externalism") debate whether justification is determined solely by [mental states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_states "Mental states") or also by external circumstances.

Separate branches of epistemology focus on knowledge in specific fields, like scientific, mathematical, moral, and religious knowledge. [Naturalized epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalized_epistemology "Naturalized epistemology") relies on empirical methods and discoveries, whereas [formal epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_epistemology "Formal epistemology") uses formal tools from [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"). [Social epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_epistemology "Social epistemology") investigates the communal aspect of knowledge, and [historical epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_epistemology "Historical epistemology") examines its historical conditions. Epistemology is closely related to [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), which describes the beliefs people hold, while epistemology studies the norms governing the evaluation of beliefs. It also intersects with fields such as [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory"), [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education"), and [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology").

Early reflections on the nature, sources, and scope of knowledge are found in [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy "Ancient Greek philosophy"), [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy "Indian philosophy"), and [Chinese philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_philosophy "Chinese philosophy"). The relation between reason and [faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith "Faith") was a central topic in the [medieval period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_period "Medieval period"). The [modern era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_era "Modern era") was characterized by the contrasting perspectives of empiricism and rationalism. Epistemologists in the 20th century examined the components, structure, and value of knowledge while integrating insights from the [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sciences "Natural sciences") and [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics").
