The [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") has a [racially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_\(human_categorization\) "Race (human categorization)") and [ethnically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity "Ethnicity") [diverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism "Multiculturalism") population. At the federal level, race and ethnicity have been categorized separately. ==The most recent [United States census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_census "United States census") recognized five [racial categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census "Race and ethnicity in the United States census") ([White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans "White Americans"), [Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans "African Americans"), [Native American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "Native Americans in the United States")/[Alaska Native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives "Alaska Natives"), [Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans "Asian Americans"), and [Native Hawaiian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians "Native Hawaiians")/[Other Pacific Islander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islander_Americans "Pacific Islander Americans"))==, as well as [people who belong to two or more of the racial categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial_Americans "Multiracial Americans"). The United States also recognizes the broader notion of ethnicity. While previous censuses inquired about the "ancestry" of residents, the current form asks people to enter their "origins".

White Americans are the majority in every census-defined region ([Northeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States "Northeastern United States"), [Midwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States "Midwestern United States"), [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States "Southern United States"), and [West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States "Western United States")) and 44 out of 50 states, except [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii"), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California"), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas"), [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico"), [Nevada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada "Nevada"), and [Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland "Maryland"). Those identifying as white alone or in combination (including multiracial white Americans) are the majority in every state except for Hawaii. The region with the highest proportion of White Americans is the Midwest, at 74.6% per the [American Community Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey "American Community Survey") (ACS), followed by the Northeast, at 64%. Non-Hispanic whites make up 73% of the Midwest's population, the highest proportion of any region, and they make up 62% of the population in the Northeast. At the same time, the regions with the smallest share of White Americans are the West, where they comprise 51.9%, and the South, where they comprise 57.7%. Non-Hispanic whites are a minority in the West, where they make up 47.1% of the population. In the South, non-Hispanic whites make up 54% of the population

## Ancestry
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States#Ancestry

The ancestry of the people of the United States is widely varied and includes descendants of populations from around the world. In addition to its variation, the ancestry of people in the United States is also marked by varying amounts of intermarriage between ethnic and racial groups.

While some Americans can trace their ancestry back to a single ethnic group or population in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa"), or [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia"), these are often first, second and third-generation Americans. Generally, the degree of mixed heritage increases the longer people's ancestors have lived in the United States (see [melting pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot "Melting pot")). There are several means available to discover the ancestry of the people living in the United States, including [genealogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy "Genealogy"), [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics "Genetics"), [oral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_history "Oral history") and [written history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History "History"), and analysis of [Federal Population Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census "United States Census") schedules; in practice, only few of these have been used for a larger part of the population.


### 2022 American Community Survey
This table displays all self-reported [ancestries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestries_of_Americans "Ancestries of Americans") with over 50,000 members, alone or in combination, according to estimates from the 2022 American Community Survey. The total population of the US according to the survey was 333,287,550, and 251,732,240 people reported an ancestry. Of these, 175,054,020 reported a single ancestry, and 76,678,224 reported two or more ancestries. Hispanic groups are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry

However, [demographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography "Demography") regard the reported number of English Americans as a statistical error, as the index of inconsistency is high and many, if not most, Americans from English stock have a tendency to identify simply as Americans, or, if of mixed European ancestry, with a different European ethnic group.
