**Sports in the United States**Â are a significant aspect of theÂ [nation's culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States "Culture of the United States"). Historically, the most popular sport has beenÂ [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball "Baseball"). In recent decades,Â [American football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football "American football")Â became the most popular spectator sport, based on broadcast viewership audience.Â [Basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball "Basketball")Â has grown into the mainstream American sports scene, since the 1980s, as didÂ [ice hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey "Ice hockey"), towards the end of the 20th century.Â [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball "Major League Baseball")Â (MLB), theÂ [National Basketball Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association "National Basketball Association")Â (NBA), theÂ [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League "National Football League")Â (NFL), and theÂ [National Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League "National Hockey League")Â (NHL) comprise the "[Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada "Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada")" of theÂ [sport industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_industry "Sport industry").

In the first half of the 20th century,Â [boxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing "Boxing")Â andÂ [collegiate football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision "NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision")Â were among the most popular sports after baseball.Â [Soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer "Soccer")Â has emerged as the fifth most popular sport in the 21st century.Â [Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf "Golf"),Â [tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis "Tennis"), andÂ [collegiate basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball "College basketball")Â are other spectator sports with longstanding popularity.Â [Tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis "Tennis")Â is currently considered to be the sixth most popular sport in the United States.Â Most recently,Â [mixed martial arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts "Mixed martial arts")Â has been breaking records in attendance and broadcast viewership for allÂ [combat sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sports "Combat sports").

Based on revenue, theÂ [major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada "Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada")Â are theÂ [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League "National Football League")Â (NFL),Â [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball "Major League Baseball")Â (MLB), theÂ [National Basketball Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association "National Basketball Association")Â (NBA), and theÂ [National Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League "National Hockey League")Â (NHL). At $16 billion in revenue, the NFL is the most valuable sports league in the world.

The market for professional sports in the United States is about $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined. All these leagues enjoy wide-ranging domestic media coverage and, except for Major League Soccer, all are considered the preeminent leagues in their respective sports in the world. Although American football does not have a substantial following in other nations, the NFL does have the highest average attendance (67,254) of any professional sports league in the world. MLB has the second highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. (29,293)Â followed by MLS, the NBA, and the NHL. Of these five U.S.-based leagues, all but the NFL have at least one team in Canada.

Professional teams in all major sports in the United States operate asÂ [franchises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports_league_organization "Professional sports league organization")Â within a league, meaning that a team may move to a different city if the team's owners believe there would be a financial benefit, but franchise moves are usually subject to some form of league-level approval. All major sports leagues use a similar type of regular-season schedule with a post-seasonÂ [playoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff "Playoff")Â tournament. In addition to the major leagueâ€“level organizations, several sports also have professionalÂ [minor leagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_league "Minor league"), active in smaller cities across the country.

As inÂ [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_in_Canada "Sports in Canada")Â andÂ [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_in_Australia "Sport in Australia"), sports leagues in the United States do not practiceÂ [promotion and relegation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation "Promotion and relegation"), unlike most sports leagues in Europe. Another notable distinction is that most sports fans in the United States tend to follow more than one team sport, depending on the time of year, unlike the case in many parts of the world where fans might avidly follow only one team sport such as soccer or baseball. Thus, it is possible for a U.S. sports fan who follows multiple sports to spend practically every single day of the year watching professional sports, since there is no time of year when all the Big Five leagues would be off-season.

Sports are particularly associated withÂ [education in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States "Education in the United States"), with mostÂ [high schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_schools_in_the_United_States "High schools in the United States")Â andÂ [universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University "University")Â having organized sports, and this is a unique sporting footprint for the U.S.Â [College sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_athletics_in_the_United_States "College athletics in the United States")Â competitions play an important role in the American sporting culture, andÂ [college basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball "College basketball")Â andÂ [college football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football "College football")Â are more popular than professional sports in some parts of the country. The major sanctioning body for college sports is theÂ [National Collegiate Athletic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association "National Collegiate Athletic Association")Â (NCAA). Colleges collectively receive billions of dollars from TV deals, sponsorships, and ticket sales. In 2019, the total revenue generated by NCAA athletic departments added up to $18.9 billion.

Based onÂ [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games "Olympic Games"), World Championships, and other major competitions in respective sports, the United States is the most successful nation in the world in baseball, basketball, athletics, swimming, lacrosse, beach volleyball, figure skating, tennis, golf, boxing, diving, shooting, rowing and snowboarding, and is one of the top five most successful nations in ice hockey,Â [wrestling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling "Wrestling"), gymnastics, volleyball, speed skating, alpine skiing, bobsleigh, equestrian, sailing,Â [cycling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling "Cycling"), weightlifting and archery, among others. This makes the United States the most successful sports nation in the world. The United States has been referred to by some as the Hegemon of World Sports.Â The United States has placed first in the Summer Olympic medal tableÂ [19 times out of 30 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_teams_by_medals_won#List_by_team "List of Olympic teams by medals won")Â and 29 appearances. Unlike most other nations, the United States government does not provide funding for sports nor for theÂ [United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_%26_Paralympic_Committee "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee"). The United States Olympic contingent is additionally the only Olympic contingent in the world to receive no government funding; neither training and development costs nor prize money are provided by the U.S. national government.
