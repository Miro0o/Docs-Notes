## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics

**Semantics** is the study of linguistic [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_\(philosophy\) "Meaning (philosophy)"). It examines what meaning is, how words get their meaning, and how the meaning of a complex expression depends on its parts. Part of this process involves the distinction between [sense and reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference "Sense and reference"). Sense is given by the ideas and concepts associated with an expression while reference is the object to which an expression points. Semantics contrasts with [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax"), which studies the rules that dictate how to create [grammatically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatically "Grammatically") correct sentences, and [pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics "Pragmatics"), which investigates how people use language in communication. Semantics, together with syntactics and pragmatics, is a part of [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics "Semiotics").

[Lexical semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_semantics "Lexical semantics") is the branch of semantics that studies [word meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_meaning "Word meaning"). It examines whether words have one or several meanings and in what [lexical relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_relations "Lexical relations") they stand to one another. Phrasal semantics studies the meaning of sentences by exploring the phenomenon of [compositionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositionality "Compositionality") or how new meanings can be created by arranging words. [Formal semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_\(natural_language\) "Formal semantics (natural language)") relies on [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") to provide precise frameworks of the relation between language and meaning. [Cognitive semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_semantics "Cognitive semantics") examines meaning from a psychological perspective and assumes a close relation between language ability and the conceptual structures used to understand the world. Other branches of semantics include [conceptual semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_semantics "Conceptual semantics"), [computational semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semantics "Computational semantics"), and cultural semantics.

Theories of meaning are general explanations of the nature of meaning and how expressions are endowed with it. According to [referential theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_reference_theory "Direct reference theory"), the meaning of an expression is the part of reality to which it points. Ideational theories identify meaning with [mental states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_states "Mental states") like the ideas that an expression evokes in the minds of language users. According to causal theories, meaning is determined by causes and effects, which [behaviorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorist "Behaviorist") semantics analyzes in terms of stimulus and response. Further theories of meaning include [truth-conditional semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-conditional_semantics "Truth-conditional semantics"), [verificationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationist "Verificationist") theories, the [use theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations#Meaning_as_use "Philosophical Investigations"), and [inferentialist semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferential_role_semantics "Inferential role semantics").

The study of semantic phenomena began during antiquity but was not recognized as an independent field of inquiry until the 19th century. Semantics is relevant to the fields of formal logic, [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology").
