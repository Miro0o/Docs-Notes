The underlying [corpus architecture](https://www.english-corpora.org/help/architecture.pdf) and web interface were created by [Mark Davies](https://www.mark-davies.org/), (retired) Professor of Linguistics. In most cases, he also designed, collected, edited, and annotated the corpora as well. In the case of the BNC, Strathy, EEBO, and Hansard corpora, I received the texts from others, and "just" created the architecture and interface. So although I use the terms "we" and "us" on this and other pages, most activities related to the development of most of these corpora were actually carried out by just one person.
