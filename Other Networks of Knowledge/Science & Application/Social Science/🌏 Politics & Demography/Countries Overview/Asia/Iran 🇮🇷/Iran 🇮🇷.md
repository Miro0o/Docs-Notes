### Bonyad
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonyad

Bonyads (Persian: بنیاد "Foundation") are charitable trusts in Iran that play a major role in Iran's economy. They control an estimated 20% of Iran's GDP,[1] and are second only to the oil industry in manufacturing, trading, and real estate development in Iran.[2] As of 2010, the largest bonyad is the Mostazafan Foundation, worth approximately $10 billion. In addition to large national bonyads like the Mostazafan Foundation, there are numerous bonyads affiliated with local clerics in "almost every" Iranian town.[3] All are answerable only to the Supreme Leader of Iran. As of 2008, bonyads employ somewhere between 400,000[4] and 5 million Iranians.[5]

Technically religious charitable organizations, they have evolved into "giant private monopolies with no governmental oversight",[6] and are now described as channeling revenues to groups supporting the Islamic Republic,[7] while providing limited and inadequate charity to the poor.[2] Exempt from taxes and benefiting from "huge subsidies from government," they have been called "bloated,"[2] and "a major weakness of Iran's economy,"[5] that siphons off production to the lucrative black market.[2]


### Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),[a] also known as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards,[19] is a multi-service primary branch of the Iranian Armed Forces. It was officially established by Ruhollah Khomeini as a military branch in May 1979 in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution.[1][20] Whereas the Iranian Army protects the country's sovereignty in a traditional capacity, the IRGC's constitutional mandate is to ensure the integrity of the Islamic Republic.[21] Most interpretations of this mandate assert that it entrusts the IRGC with preventing foreign interference in Iran, thwarting coups by the traditional military, and crushing "deviant movements" that harm the ideological legacy of the Islamic Revolution.[22]

As of 2024, the IRGC had approximately 125,000 total personnel. The IRGC Navy is now Iran's primary force exercising operational control over the Persian Gulf,[23] serving as a de facto coast guard. The IRGC's Basij, a paramilitary volunteer militia, has a further approximately 90,000 active personnel.[24][25] It operates a media arm, known as "Sepah News" within Iran.[26] On 16 March 2022, it adopted a new independent branch called the "Command for the Protection and Security of Nuclear Centres" involved with Iran's nuclear program.[27] Currently, the IRGC is designated as a terrorist organization by Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Ecuador, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Sweden and the United States.[28][29][30]

Originating as an ideological militia, the IRGC has taken on a growing role in nearly every aspect of Iranian politics, economics (including energy and food industries) and society. In 2010, BBC News described the organization as a "business empire".[31] In 2019, Reuters described it as "an industrial empire with political clout".[32] IRGC's expanded social, political, military, and economic role under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad—especially during the 2009 presidential election and the suppression of post-election protests—has led many Western analysts to argue that it has surpassed even the country's ruling clerical class in terms of political power.[33][34][35][36]

From 2019 to 2025, Hossein Salami served as the IRGC's incumbent commander-in-chief.[37][32] He was killed along with numerous senior officers during the wave of Israeli strikes launched on 13 June 2025.[38]
