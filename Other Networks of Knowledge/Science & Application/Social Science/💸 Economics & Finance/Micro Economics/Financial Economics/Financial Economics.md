**Financial economics** is the branch of [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") characterized by a "concentration on monetary activities", in which "money of one type or another is likely to appear on _both sides_ of a trade". Its concern is thus the interrelation of financial variables, such as [share prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price "Share price"), [interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate") and [exchange rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate "Exchange rate"), as opposed to those concerning the [real economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_economy "Real economy"). It has two main areas of focus: [asset pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_pricing "Asset pricing") and [corporate finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_finance "Corporate finance"); the first being the perspective of providers of [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_capital "Financial capital"), i.e. investors, and the second of users of capital. It thus provides the theoretical underpinning for much of [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance "Finance").

The subject is concerned with "the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment".  It therefore centers on decision making under uncertainty in the context of the financial markets, and the resultant [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_model "Economic model") and [financial models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_model "Financial model") and principles, and is concerned with deriving testable or policy implications from acceptable assumptions. It thus also includes a formal study of the [financial markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market "Financial market") themselves, especially [market microstructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_microstructure "Market microstructure") and [market regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation "Financial regulation"). It is built on the foundations of [microeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics "Microeconomics") and [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory").

[Financial econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_econometrics "Financial econometrics") is the branch of financial economics that uses [econometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics "Econometrics") techniques to parameterise the relationships identified. [Mathematical finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance "Mathematical finance") is related in that it will derive and extend the mathematical or numerical models suggested by financial economics. Whereas financial economics has a primarily microeconomic focus, [monetary economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_economics "Monetary economics") is primarily [macroeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomic "Macroeconomic") in nature.
