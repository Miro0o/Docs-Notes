In finance, a derivative is a contract between a buyer and a seller. The derivative can take various forms, depending on the transaction, but every derivative has the following four elements:
- an item (the "underlier") that can or must be bought or sold,
- a future act which must occur (such as a sale or purchase of the underlier),
- a price at which the future transaction must take place, and
- a future date by which the act (such as a purchase or sale) must take place.[1]

A derivative's value depends on the performance of the underlier, which can be a commodity (for example, corn or oil), a financial instrument (e.g. a stock or a bond), a price index, a currency, or an interest rate.[2][3]

Derivatives can be used to insure against price movements (hedging), increase exposure to price movements for speculation, or get access to otherwise hard-to-trade assets or markets.[4] Most derivatives are price guarantees. But some are based on an event or performance of an act rather than a price. Agriculture, natural gas, electricity and oil businesses use derivatives to mitigate risk from adverse weather.[5][1] Derivatives can be used to protect lenders against the risk of borrowers defaulting on an obligation.[6]

Some of the more common derivatives include forwards, futures, options, swaps, and variations of these such as synthetic collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. Most derivatives are traded over-the-counter (off-exchange) or on an exchange such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while most insurance contracts have developed into a separate industry. In the United States, after the 2008 financial crisis, there has been increased pressure to move derivatives to trade on exchanges.

Derivatives are one of the three main categories of financial instruments, the other two being equity (i.e., stocks or shares) and debt (i.e., bonds and mortgages). The oldest example of a derivative in history, attested to by Aristotle, is thought to be a contract transaction of olives, entered into by ancient Greek philosopher Thales, who made a profit in the exchange.[7] However, Aristotle did not define this arrangement as a derivative but as a monopoly (Aristotle's Politics, Book I, Chapter XI). Bucket shops, outlawed in 1936 in the US, are a more recent historical example.


### Usage
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#Usage

Derivatives are used for the following:
- Hedge or to mitigate risk in the underlying, by entering into a derivative contract whose value moves in the opposite direction to their underlying position and cancels part or all of it out[20][21]
- Create option ability where the value of the derivative is linked to a specific condition or event (e.g., the underlying reaching a specific price level)
- Obtain exposure to the underlying where it is not possible to trade in the underlying (e.g., weather derivatives)[22]
- Provide leverage (or gearing), such that a small movement in the underlying value can cause a large difference in the value of the derivative[23]
- Speculate and make a profit if the value of the underlying asset moves the way they expect (e.g. moves in a given direction, stays in or out of a specified range, reaches a certain level)
- Switch asset allocations between different asset classes without disturbing the underlying assets, as part of transition management
- Avoid paying taxes. For example, an equity swap allows an investor to receive steady payments, e.g. based on SONIA rate, while avoiding paying capital gains tax and keeping the stock.
- For arbitraging purpose, allowing a riskless profit by simultaneously entering into transactions into two or more markets.[24]


### Types of Derivatives
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#Types

In broad terms, there are two groups of derivative contracts, which are distinguished by the way they are traded in the market: over-the-counter derivatives (OTC) and exchange-traded derivatives (ETD).
#### OTC (Over-The-Counter) Derivatives
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#Over-the-counter_derivatives

[Over-the-counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_\(finance\) "Over-the-counter (finance)") (OTC) derivatives are contracts that are traded (and privately negotiated) directly between two parties, without going through an exchange or other intermediary. Products such as [swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_\(finance\) "Swap (finance)"), [forward rate agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_rate_agreement "Forward rate agreement"), [exotic options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_option "Exotic option") – and other [exotic derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_derivative "Exotic derivative") – are almost always traded in this way. The OTC derivative market is the largest market for derivatives, and is largely unregulated with respect to disclosure of information between the parties, since the OTC market is made up of banks and other highly sophisticated parties, such as [hedge funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund "Hedge fund"). Reporting of OTC amounts is difficult because trades can occur in private, without activity being visible on any exchanges.

According to the [Bank for International Settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements "Bank for International Settlements"), who first surveyed OTC derivatives in 1995, reported that the "gross [market value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value "Market value"), which represent the cost of replacing all open contracts at the prevailing market prices, ... increased by 74% since 2004, to $11 trillion at the end of June 2007 (BIS 2007:24)." [Positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_\(finance\) "Position (finance)") in the OTC derivatives market increased to $516 trillion at the end of June 2007, 135% higher than the level recorded in 2004. The total outstanding notional amount is US$708 trillion (as of June 2011). Of this total notional amount, 67% are [interest rate contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_derivative "Interest rate derivative"), 8% are [credit default swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap "Credit default swap") (CDSs), 9% are foreign exchange contracts, 2% are commodity contracts, 1% are equity contracts, and 12% are other. Because OTC derivatives are not traded on an exchange, there is no central counter-party. Therefore, they are subject to [counterparty risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk#Counterparty_risk "Credit risk"), like an ordinary [contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract "Contract"), since each counter-party relies on the other to perform.
#### ETD (Exchange-Traded Derivatives)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#Exchange-traded_derivatives

[Exchange-traded derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_derivative_contract "Exchange-traded derivative contract") (ETD) are those derivatives instruments that are traded via specialized [derivatives exchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivatives_exchange) or other exchanges. A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange. A derivatives exchange acts as an intermediary to all related transactions, and takes [initial margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_margin "Initial margin") from both sides of the trade to act as a guarantee. The world's largest derivatives exchanges (by number of transactions) are the [Korea Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Exchange "Korea Exchange") (which lists [KOSPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSPI "KOSPI") Index Futures & Options), [Eurex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurex "Eurex") (which lists a wide range of European products such as interest rate & index products), and [CME Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CME_Group "CME Group") (made up of the 2007 merger of the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange "Chicago Mercantile Exchange") and the [Chicago Board of Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Board_of_Trade "Chicago Board of Trade") and the 2008 acquisition of the [New York Mercantile Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mercantile_Exchange "New York Mercantile Exchange")). According to BIS, the combined turnover in the world's derivatives exchanges totaled US$344 trillion during Q4 2005. By December 2007 the [Bank for International Settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements "Bank for International Settlements") reported that "derivatives traded on exchanges surged 27% to a record $681 trillion."
#### Inverse ETFs and leveraged ETFs
> 🔗 [Exchange-traded fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#Inverse_ETFs_and_leveraged_ETFs

[Inverse exchange-traded funds (IETFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_exchange-traded_fund "Inverse exchange-traded fund") and [leveraged exchange-traded funds (LETFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund#Leveraged_ETFs "Exchange-traded fund") are two special types of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that are available to common traders and investors on major exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq. To maintain these products' [net asset value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_asset_value "Net asset value"), these funds' administrators must employ more sophisticated [financial engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_engineering "Financial engineering") methods than what's usually required for maintenance of traditional ETFs. These instruments must also be regularly [rebalanced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebalancing "Rebalancing") and re-indexed each day.


### Common Derivative Contract
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#Common_derivative_contract

Some of the common variants of derivative contracts are as follows:
1. [Forwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_contract "Forward contract"): tailored contract between two parties, where payment takes place at a specific time in the future at today's pre-determined price.
2. [Futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract "Futures contract"): contracts to buy or sell an asset on a future date at a price specified today. A futures contract differs from a forward contract in that the futures contract is a standardized contract written by a [clearing house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_house_\(finance\) "Clearing house (finance)") that operates an exchange where the contract can be bought and sold; the forward contract is a non-standardized contract written by the parties themselves.
3. [Options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_\(finance\) "Option (finance)"): contracts that give the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a [call option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option "Call option")) or sell (in the case of a [put option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option "Put option")) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the [strike price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_price "Strike price"), and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. In the case of a [European option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_option "European option"), the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; in the case of an [American option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_option "American option"), the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the obligation to carry out the transaction. Options are of two types: [call option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option "Call option") and [put option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option "Put option").
4. [Swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_\(finance\) "Swap (finance)"): contracts to exchange cash (flows) on or before a specified future date based on the underlying value of currencies exchange rates, bonds/interest rates, [commodities exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodities_exchange "Commodities exchange"), stocks or other assets.
	1. Swaps can basically be categorized into [Interest rate swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_swap "Interest rate swap") and [currency swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-currency_swap "Cross-currency swap").
5. [Binary options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_option "Binary option"): contracts that provide the owner with an all-or-nothing profit profile.
6. [Warrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_\(finance\) "Warrant (finance)"): apart from the commonly used short-dated options which have a maximum maturity period of one year, there exist certain long-dated options as well, known as [warrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_\(finance\) "Warrant (finance)"). These are generally traded over the counter.

Some common examples of these derivatives are the following:
