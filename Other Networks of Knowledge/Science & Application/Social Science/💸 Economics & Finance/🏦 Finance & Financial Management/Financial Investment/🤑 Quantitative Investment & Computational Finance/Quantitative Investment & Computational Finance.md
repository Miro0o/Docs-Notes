## Intro
### Computational Finance 
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_finance

Computational finance is a branch of applied computer science that deals with problems of practical interest in finance.[1] Some slightly different definitions are the study of data and algorithms currently used in finance[2] and the mathematics of computer programs that realize financial models or systems.[3]

Computational finance emphasizes practical numerical methods rather than mathematical proofs and focuses on techniques that apply directly to economic analyses.[4] It is an interdisciplinary field between mathematical finance and numerical methods.[5] Two major areas are efficient and accurate computation of fair values of financial securities and the modeling of stochastic time series.[6]
