Monetary economics is the branch of economics that studies the nature, role, and impact of money and monetary institutions. It provides a framework for analyzing money and its core functions—as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account—and examines how money can achieve widespread acceptance, including through its role as a public good.[1]

Historically, monetary economics has both prefigured and remained closely integrated with the development of macroeconomics.[2] The field investigates the functioning and regulation of different monetary systems, the design and role of financial institutions, and the international dimensions of monetary relations such as exchange rates and global liquidity.[3][4]

Central themes in monetary economics include the analysis of inflation, the role of money supply in economic activity, the design and effectiveness of monetary policy, and the relationship between money, output, and employment. Research in this area provides the theoretical foundations for central banking and informs debates on issues such as currency regimes, financial stability, and the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy.

Modern analysis has attempted to provide microfoundations for the demand for money[5] and to distinguish valid nominal and real monetary relationships for micro or macro uses, including their influence on the aggregate demand for output.[6] Its methods include deriving and testing the implications of money as a substitute for other assets[7] and as based on explicit frictions.[8]
