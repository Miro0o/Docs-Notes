**Corporate law** (also known as **company law** or **enterprise law**) is the body of [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law "Law") governing the [rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights "Rights"), relations, and conduct of [persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person "Legal person"), [companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company "Company"), [organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization "Organization"), and [businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business "Business"). The term refers to the legal practice of law relating to [corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation "Corporation"), or to the theory of corporations. Corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly from the life-cycle of a corporation.  It thus encompasses the [formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_\(business\) "Incorporation (business)"), funding, governance, and [death of a corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_dissolution "Corporate dissolution").

While the minute nature of corporate governance as personified by [share ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholders "Shareholders"), [capital market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market "Capital market"), and [business culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_culture "Business culture") rules differ, similar legal characteristics and legal problems exist across many jurisdictions. Corporate law regulates how corporations, [investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor "Investor"), [shareholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholders "Shareholders"), [directors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors "Board of directors"), employees, [creditors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditors "Creditors"), and other [stakeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_\(corporate\) "Stakeholder (corporate)") such as [consumers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer "Consumer"), the [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community "Community"), and the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_\(biophysical\) "Environment (biophysical)") interact with one another.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_law#cite_note-armour-1) Whereas the terms company law or business law may be colloquially used interchangeably with corporate law, the term business law in fact refers to wider concepts of [commercial law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_law "Commercial law"), which is the law governing commercial and business-related activities. Depending on the [legal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_system "Legal system"), this may include matters relating to [corporate governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_governance "Corporate governance"), [financial law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_law "Financial law"), [contract law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_law "Contract law") and other pertinent areas.
