## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory

**Decision theory** or the **theory of rational choice** is a branch of [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), and [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy "Analytic philosophy") that uses [expected utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility "Expected utility") and [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilities "Probabilities") to model how individuals would behave [rationally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality") under [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty "Uncertainty"). It differs from the [cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science") and [behavioral sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_sciences "Behavioural sciences") in that it is mainly [prescriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescriptive_economics "Prescriptive economics") and concerned with identifying [optimal decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_decision "Optimal decision") for a [rational agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent "Rational agent"), rather than [describing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_economics "Descriptive economics") how people actually make decisions. Despite this, the field is important to the study of real human behavior by [social scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science"), as it lays the foundations to [mathematically model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") and analyze individuals in fields such as [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [criminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology "Criminology"), [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science"), [moral philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_philosophy "Moral philosophy") and [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science").

## Ref
[Decision analysis]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis
Decision analysis (DA) is the discipline comprising the philosophy, methodology, and professional practice necessary to address important decisions in a formal manner. Decision analysis includes many procedures, methods, and tools for identifying, clearly representing, and formally assessing important aspects of a decision; for prescribing a recommended course of action by applying the maximum expected-utility axiom to a well-formed representation of the decision; and for translating the formal representation of a decision and its corresponding recommendation into insight for the decision maker, and other corporate and non-corporate stakeholders.
