# 1.4
## four sources of packet delay
+ nodal processing delay
	+ check bit errors
		+ CRC
	+ determine output link
+ transmission delay
	+ delay in uploading data to the link
	+ depends on [bandwidth](https://baike.baidu.com/item/带宽/266879) ↓
	+ bandwidth = transmission rate
	+ = the rate of transforming **binary num (0/1)** to** electrical/ optic signa** 
+ propagation delay
	+ time takes on the physical link
		+ length of physical link 
		+ propagation speed in medium ($2*10^8$ m/s)
	+ **bandwidth-delay product**
		+ the total amount of bit on a full-loaded physical link
		+ $=R(b/s)*Dprop(s)=R*D$
		+ R: stransmission rate

		+  compared with **bandwidth**, which is the theorical rate.  
	+  each connection path between host is referred as **flow**
	+  condisder an optimal distribution strategy:
