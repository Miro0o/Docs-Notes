### Economics
One classical breakdown of economic activity distinguishes [three sectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model "Three-sector model"):
- [Primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy "Primary sector of the economy"): involves the retrieval and production of raw-material [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity "Commodity"), such as corn, coal, wood or iron. Miners, farmers and fishermen are all workers in the primary sector.
- [Secondary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy "Secondary sector of the economy"): involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into [goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods "Goods"), as in steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. Builders and dressmakers work in the secondary sector.
- [Tertiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy "Tertiary sector of the economy"): involves the supplying of services to consumers and businesses, such as babysitting, cinemas or banking. Shopkeepers and accountants work in the tertiary sector.

In the 20th century, economists began to suggest that traditional tertiary services could be further distinguished from "[quaternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_sector_of_the_economy "Quaternary sector of the economy")" and [quinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinary_sector_of_the_economy "Quinary sector of the economy") service sectors. Economic activity in the hypothetical quaternary sector comprises information- and knowledge-based services, while quinary services include industries related to [human services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_services "Human services") and [hospitality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry "Hospitality industry").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sector#cite_note-2)

Economic theories divide economic sectors further into [economic industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_\(economics\) "Industry (economics)").

[👍 Government Information 101: Part 1, U.S. Gov Basics | Journalism Library Blog, Columbia University Library]: https://blogs.library.columbia.edu/journalism/2014/02/govinfo101/
New to the U.S., or just need to brush-up on **some government basics?** Here's a quick run-down of U.S. government at various levels and how to find government information. (I'll be writing two follow-up posts that tell where to find primary source information for each branch of government, and show an example of a gov info search.) First, here is a **[U.S. government chart](http://www.netage.com/economics/gov/images-org/gov_chart-landscape.pdf)** and **three basic guides** to the **federal government**:

- [Ben's Guide](http://bensguide.gpo.gov/9-12/index.html)
- [The U.S. Government Manual](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GOVMAN-2013-11-06/pdf/GOVMAN-2013-11-06.pdf)
- [How Laws Are Made](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDOC-110hdoc49/pdf/CDOC-110hdoc49.pdf)


**Levels & Branches of Government**

The United States has several **levels** of government: **federal**, **state**, and **local** (county/city). **Federal** is the overarching national government, which has [**three branches**](http://www.house.gov/content/learn/branches_of_government/):
- **Legislative** (makes the law)
    - Composed of [Congress](http://congress.gov/), which is made up of the [House](http://www.house.gov/) and the [Senate](http://www.senate.gov/)
- **Executive** (implements and enforces the law)
    - Composed of the [President](http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration) and many [federal departments, agencies, and offices](http://www.usa.gov/Agencies.shtml)
- **Judicial**(interprets the law)
    - Composed of the [Supreme Court](http://www.supremecourt.gov/) and the [federal court system](http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts.aspx)

Each [**state** has its own government](http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/state-and-local-government) which echoes the federal government in its three-branch organization. The Legislative branch is composed of the state senate and house (or assembly), the Executive branch is composed of the Governor and typically many departments (structure varies by state), and the Judicial branch is composed of the state court system, headed by the state supreme court. There are different **local government** offices at the county and the municipal (city/town) level. Typically, cities follow a similar pattern to federal and state government, with a Mayor acting as the chief executive officer of a city. Usually, a county is larger than and encompasses many cities and towns. However, [New York City](http://www1.nyc.gov/) is made up of five boroughs, which are each actually counties (listed at right).


**What Topics are Covered by Government Documents?**

The U.S. government covers a surprising number of programs, and thus data and information is available on nearly any topic you can think of, including:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|- Data & Statistics<br>- Health & Vital Statistics<br>- Politics & Law<br>- Business & Economy<br>- Treaties<br>- Scientific & Medical Research|- Technology<br>- Intellectual Property (patents, trademarks, copyright)<br>- Historical Events (primary resources)<br>- Consumer Information<br>- Grants<br>- Starting & Financing a Small Business|- Recipes & Nutrition<br>- Maps<br>- Education, Teacher Resources<br>- Rules & Regulations<br>- …and you can use [**Browse Topics**](http://www.browsetopics.gov/) or the [**US Gov Portal**](http://www.usa.gov/) to find more!|

Some of the **few topics that aren't covered well** in U.S. gov info include:
- Literature
- Arts
    - Exceptions: arts funding (NEA, NEH), nonprofit finances, & some gov-funded museum exhibits are covered; in addition, Whistler briefly worked for the Coastal Survey and produced engravings
- Music
    - Exception: music copyright and copyright cases are well covered
