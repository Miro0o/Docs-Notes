### Economics
One classical breakdown of economic activity distinguishes [three sectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_model "Three-sector model"):
- [Primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector_of_the_economy "Primary sector of the economy"): involves the retrieval and production of raw-material [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity "Commodity"), such as corn, coal, wood or iron. Miners, farmers and fishermen are all workers in the primary sector.
- [Secondary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy "Secondary sector of the economy"): involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into [goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods "Goods"), as in steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. Builders and dressmakers work in the secondary sector.
- [Tertiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy "Tertiary sector of the economy"): involves the supplying of services to consumers and businesses, such as babysitting, cinemas or banking. Shopkeepers and accountants work in the tertiary sector.

In the 20th century, economists began to suggest that traditional tertiary services could be further distinguished from "[quaternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_sector_of_the_economy "Quaternary sector of the economy")" and [quinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinary_sector_of_the_economy "Quinary sector of the economy") service sectors. Economic activity in the hypothetical quaternary sector comprises information- and knowledge-based services, while quinary services include industries related to [human services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_services "Human services") and [hospitality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry "Hospitality industry").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sector#cite_note-2)

Economic theories divide economic sectors further into [economic industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_\(economics\) "Industry (economics)").
