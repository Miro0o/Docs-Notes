## Intro
Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others. Use the `conda install` command to install 720+ additional conda packages from the Anaconda repository.
