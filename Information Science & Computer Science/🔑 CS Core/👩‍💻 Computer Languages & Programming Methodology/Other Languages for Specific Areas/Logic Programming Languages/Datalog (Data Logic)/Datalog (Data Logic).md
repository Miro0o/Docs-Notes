**Datalog** is a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming") [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming "Logic programming") language. While it is syntactically a subset of [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog"), Datalog generally uses a bottom-up rather than top-down evaluation model. This difference yields significantly different behavior and properties from [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog"). It is often used as a [query language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language "Query language") for [deductive databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_database "Deductive database"). Datalog has been applied to problems in [data integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration "Data integration"), [networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), [program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis "Program analysis"), and more.
