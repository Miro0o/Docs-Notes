## How to include Nerd Fonts in LaTex?
#latex #nerd_fonts

Assuming unicode, direct input of the unicode glyphs would work.

You can specify the unicode codepoint in ASCII in some cases, e.g.Â `^^^^00be`Â will give you the unicode codepoint for the 3/4 vulgar fraction.

That works for one- and two-byte unicode codepoints, I do not know if it works for three-byte.

Of course, your icon font has to be selected first. I assume you know how to do that?
