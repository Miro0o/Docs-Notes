Welcome to the Swift community. Together we are working to build a programming language to empower everyone to turn their ideas into apps on any platform.



## Intro
**Swift** is a powerful and intuitive programming language for **iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS**. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design and produces software that runs lightning-fast.

Swift was introduced at Apple's [2014 Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference#2010s "Apple Worldwide Developers Conference") (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a [proprietary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_programming_language "Proprietary programming language"), version 2.2 was made [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") under the [Apache License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License "Apache License") 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple's platforms and Linux.
