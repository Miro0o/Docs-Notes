## Intro
[bpython](http://www.bpython-interpreter.org/) is a lightweight Python interpreter that adds several features common to IDEs. These features include **syntax highlighting**, **expected parameter list**, **auto-indentation**, and **autocompletion**. (See below for example usage).

bpython does **not** aim to be a complete IDE - the focus is on implementing a few ideas in a practical, useful, and lightweight manner.

bpython is a great replacement to any occasion where you would normally use the vanilla Python interpreter - testing out solutions to people's problems on IRC, quickly testing a method of doing something without creating a temporary file, etc.
