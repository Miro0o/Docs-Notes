# IP Anycasting (任播)

[TOC]



## Res


## Intro
**Anycast** is a network addressing and routing methodology in which a single destination IP address is shared by devices (generally servers) in multiple locations. Routers direct packets addressed to this destination to the location nearest the sender, using their normal decision-making algorithms, typically the lowest number of [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_gateway_protocol "Border gateway protocol") [network hops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop_(networking) "Hop (networking)"). Anycast routing is widely used by [content delivery networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network "Content delivery network") such as web and DNS hosts, to bring their content closer to end users.
