> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Gateway_Device_Protocol

**Internet Gateway Device (UPnP IGD) Control Protocol** is a protocol based on UPnP for mapping ports in network address translation (NAT) setups, supported by some NAT-enabled routers. It is a common communications protocol for automatically configuring port forwarding, and is part of an ISO/IEC Standard[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] rather than an Internet Engineering Task Force standard.
