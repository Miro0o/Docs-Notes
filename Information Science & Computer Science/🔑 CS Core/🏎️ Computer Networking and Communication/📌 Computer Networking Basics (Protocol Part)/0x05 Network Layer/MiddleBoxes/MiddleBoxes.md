## Intro
In the past 20 years, we‚Äôve seen tremendous growth in such middleboxes, which [RFC 3234] defines as:

> "any intermediary box performing functions apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data path between a source host and destination host"

We can broadly identify **three types of services performed by middleboxes**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **NAT Translation**. NAT boxes implement private network addressing, rewriting datagram header IP addresses and port numbers.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Security Services**. 
	- **Firewalls** block traffic based on header-field values or redirect packets for additional processing, such as **deep packet inspection (DPI)**.
	- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** are able to detect predetermined patterns and filter packets accordingly. 
	- Application-level e-mail **filters** block e-mails considered to be junk, phishing or otherwise posing a security threat.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Performance Enhancement**. These middleboxes perform services such as **compression**, **content caching**, and **load balancing** of service requests (e.g., an HTTP request, or a search engine query) to one of a set of servers that can provide the desired service.

Many other middleboxes [RFC 3234] provide capabilities belonging to these three types of services, in both wired and wireless cellular [Wang 2011] networks.

### Middlebox: Pro /Against
For many years, the Internet architecture had a clear separation between the network layer and the transport/application layers. 

In these ‚Äúgood old days,‚Äù the network layer consisted of routers, operating within the network core, to forward datagrams toward their destinations using fields only in the IP datagram header. The transport and application layers were implemented in hosts operating at the network edge. Hosts exchanged packets among themselves in transport-layer segments and application-layer messages. 

Today‚Äôs middleboxes clearly violate this separation: a NAT box, sitting between a router and host, rewrites network-layer IP addresses and transport-layer port numbers; an in-network firewall blocks suspect datagrams using application-layer (e.g., HTTP), transport-layer, and network-layer header fields; e-mail security gateways are injected between the e-mail sender (whether malicious or not) and the intended e-mail receiver, filtering application-layer e-mail messages based on whitelisted/blacklisted IP addresses as well as e-mail message content. 

- While there are those who have considered such middleboxes as a bit of an archi- tectural abomination [Garfinkel 2003], 
- others have adopted the philosophy that such middleboxes ‚Äúexist for important and permanent reasons‚Äù‚Äîthat they fill an important need‚Äîand that we‚Äôll have more, not fewer, middleboxes in the future [Walfish 2004].
