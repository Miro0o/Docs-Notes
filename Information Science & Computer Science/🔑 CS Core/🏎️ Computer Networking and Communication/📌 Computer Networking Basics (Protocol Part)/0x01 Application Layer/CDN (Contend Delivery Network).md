## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network#

A **content delivery network** (**CDN**) or **content distribution network** is a geographically distributed network of [proxy servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server "Proxy server") and corresponding [data centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center "Data center"). CDNs provide high [availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_\(system\) "Availability (system)") and performance ("speed") through geographical distribution relative to [end users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user "End user"), and arose in the late 1990s to alleviate the performance bottlenecks of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") as it was becoming a critical medium. Since then, CDNs have grown to serve a large portion of Internet content, including text, graphics and [scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language "Scripting language"), downloadable objects (media files, software, and documents), applications ([e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce "E-commerce"), [portals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_portal "Web portal")), [live streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_streaming "Live streaming") media, on-demand streaming media, and [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media") services.

CDNs are a [layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer "Abstraction layer") in the internet ecosystem. Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users. In turn, a CDN pays [Internet service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider "Internet service provider") (ISPs), carriers, and network operators for hosting its servers in their data centers.

CDN is an umbrella term spanning different types of content delivery services: [video streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_streaming "Video streaming"), software downloads, web and mobile content acceleration, licensed/managed CDN, transparent caching, and services to measure CDN performance, [load balancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_\(computing\) "Load balancing (computing)"), Multi CDN switching and analytics and cloud intelligence. CDN vendors may cross over into other industries like security, [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS "DDoS") protection and [web application firewalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall "Web application firewall") (WAF), and WAN optimization.

Content delivery service providers include [Akamai Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akamai_Technologies "Akamai Technologies"), [Cloudflare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare "Cloudflare"), [Amazon CloudFront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront "Amazon CloudFront"), Qwilt (Cisco), [Fastly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastly "Fastly"), and [Google Cloud CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform "Google Cloud Platform").
