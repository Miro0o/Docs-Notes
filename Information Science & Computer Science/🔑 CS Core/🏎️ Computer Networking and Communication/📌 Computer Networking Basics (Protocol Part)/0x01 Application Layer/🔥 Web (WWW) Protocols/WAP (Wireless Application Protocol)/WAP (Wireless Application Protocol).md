## Intro
**Wireless Application Protocol** (**WAP**) is a technical standard for accessing information over a mobile wireless network. 

A **WAP browser** is a web browser for mobile devices such as mobile phones that use the protocol. 

Introduced in 1999, WAP achieved some popularity in the early 2000s, but by the 2010s it had been largely superseded by more modern standards. Almost all modern handset internet browsers now fully support [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), so they do not need to use WAP markup for web page compatibility, and therefore, most are no longer able to render and display pages written in [WML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Markup_Language), WAP's markup language.

Before the introduction of WAP, mobile service providers had limited opportunities to offer interactive data services, but needed interactivity to support [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) and [Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWW) applications such as email, stock prices, news and sports headlines. The Japanese [i-mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-mode) system offered another major competing wireless data protocol.
