Common layouts are:
- [Bus network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_network "Bus network"): all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium.
	- This was the layout used in the originalÂ [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"), calledÂ [10BASE5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE5 "10BASE5")Â andÂ [10BASE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2 "10BASE2"). 
	- This is still a common topology on theÂ [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer "Data link layer"), 
	- although modernÂ [physical layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer "Physical layer")Â variants useÂ [point-to-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_(telecommunications) "Point-to-point (telecommunications)")Â links instead, forming a star or a tree.
- [Star network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network "Star network"): all nodes are connected to a special central node.
	- This is the typical layout found in a smallÂ [switched Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_Ethernet "Switched Ethernet")Â LAN, where each client connects to a central network switch
	- and logically in aÂ [wireless LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN "Wireless LAN"), where each wireless client associates with the centralÂ [wireless access point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point "Wireless access point").
- [Ring network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_network "Ring network"): each node is connected to its left and right neighbor node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left or rightwards.
	- [Token ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring "Token ring")Â networks, and 
	- theÂ [Fiber Distributed Data Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface "Fiber Distributed Data Interface")Â (FDDI), made use of such a topology.
- [Mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_network "Mesh network"): each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbors in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.
- [Fully connected network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_connected_network "Fully connected network"): each node is connected to every other node in the network.
- [Tree network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_network "Tree network"): nodes are arranged hierarchically. This is the natural topology for a larger Ethernet network with multiple switches and without redundant meshing.
