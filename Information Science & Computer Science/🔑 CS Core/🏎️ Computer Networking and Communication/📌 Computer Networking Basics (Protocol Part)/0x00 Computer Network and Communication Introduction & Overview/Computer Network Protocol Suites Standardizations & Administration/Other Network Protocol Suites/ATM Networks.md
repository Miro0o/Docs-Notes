**Asynchronous Transfer Mode**Â (**ATM**) is aÂ telecommunicationsÂ standard defined by theÂ [American National Standards Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute "American National Standards Institute")Â andÂ [ITU-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T "ITU-T")Â (formerly CCITT) for digital transmission of multiple types of traffic. ATM was developed to meet the needs of theÂ [Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband_Integrated_Services_Digital_Network "Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network")Â as defined in the late 1980s, and designed to integrate telecommunication networks. It can handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic andÂ real-time,Â low-latencyÂ content such asÂ telephony (voice) and video. ATM provides functionality that uses features ofÂ circuit switchingÂ andÂ packet switching networks by usingÂ [asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication "Asynchronous communication")Â [time-division multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing "Time-division multiplexing")

The ATM network reference model approximately maps to the three lowest layers of the OSI model:Â [physical layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer "Physical layer"), data link layer, andÂ [network layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer "Network layer"). ATM is a core protocol used in theÂ [synchronous optical networking and synchronous digital hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SONET/SDH "SONET/SDH")(SONET/SDH) backbone of theÂ [public switched telephone network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network "Public switched telephone network")Â and in theÂ [Integrated Services Digital Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Services_Digital_Network "Integrated Services Digital Network")Â (ISDN) but has largely been superseded in favor ofÂ [next-generation networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-generation_network "Next-generation network")Â based on IP technology. Wireless and mobile ATM never established a significant foothold.
