**Frame Relay**Â is a standardizedÂ [wide area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network "Wide area network")Â (WAN) technology that specifies theÂ [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer "Physical layer")Â andÂ [data link layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer "Data link layer")Â of digital telecommunications channels using aÂ [packet switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching "Packet switching")Â methodology. Originally designed for transport acrossÂ [Integrated Services Digital Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Services_Digital_Network "Integrated Services Digital Network")Â (ISDN) infrastructure, it may be used today in the context of many other network interfaces.

Network providers commonly implement Frame Relay for voice ([VoFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoFR "VoFR")) and data as anÂ [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking) "Encapsulation (networking)")Â technique used betweenÂ [local area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network")Â (LANs) over a WAN. Each end-user gets aÂ [private line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_line "Private line")Â (orÂ [leased line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leased_line "Leased line")) to a Frame RelayÂ [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking) "Node (networking)"). The Frame Relay network handles the transmission over a frequently changing path transparent to all end-user extensively used WAN protocols. It is less expensive than leased lines and that is one reason for its popularity. The extreme simplicity of configuring user equipment in a Frame Relay network offers another reason for Frame Relay's popularity.

With the advent ofÂ [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet")Â over fiber optics,Â [MPLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching "Multiprotocol Label Switching"),Â [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network "Virtual private network")Â and dedicatedÂ [broadband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband "Broadband") services such asÂ [cable modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_modem "Cable modem")Â andÂ [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line "Digital subscriber line"), Frame Relay has become less popular in recent years.
