The public switched telephone network, or PSTN, is the world's collection of interconnected voice-oriented public telephone networks. PSTN is the traditionalÂ [circuit-switched](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/circuit-switched)Â telephone network. PSTN comprises all the switched telephone networks around the world that are operated by local, national or international carriers. These networks provide theÂ [infrastructure](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/infrastructure)Â and services for publicÂ [telecommunication](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/telecommunications-telecom).

This is the system that has been in general use since the late 1800s. It's the aggregation of circuit-switching telephone networks that has evolved from the days of Alexander Graham Bell.

Using underground copper wires, this legacy platform has provided businesses and households alike with a reliable means to communicate with anyone around the world for generations. Today, it is almost entirely digital.

The phones themselves are known by several names, such as PSTN,Â [landlines](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/landline), Plain Old Telephone Service ([POTS](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/plain-old-telephone-service-POTS)), or fixed-line telephones.
