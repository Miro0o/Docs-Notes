### üéØ Generic Global Search Services
1. [Google](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#google)
   No need for further introductions. [**Google**](https://www.google.com/) holds first place in search with a stunning difference of 88.28% from second place Bing.

   According to statistics from **[statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)** and **[statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share)**, Google is dominating the market in all countries on any device (desktop, mobile, and tablet).

2. [Microsoft Bing](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#bing)

3. [Yahoo](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#yahoo)
   [**Yahoo**](https://www.yahoo.com/) is one of the most popular email providers and its web search engine holds third place in search with an average of 1% market share.

4. [Baidu](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#baidu)
   Dumbest shit ever. üí©

5. [Yandex](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#yandex)
   Yandex presents itself as a technology company that builds intelligent products and services powered by machine learning.

   According to Wikipedia, Yandex operates the largest search engine in Russia with about 65% market share in that country.

6. [DuckDuckGo](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#duckduckgo)
   According to DuckDuckGo [**traffic stats**,](https://duckduckgo.com/traffic) they are serving on average 90+ million searches per day but still their overall market share is constantly below 0.6%.

   Unlike what most people believe, [**DuckDuckGo**](https://duckduckgo.com/) does not have a search index of its own (like Google and Bing) but they generate its search results using a variety of **[sources](https://help.duckduckgo.com/results/sources/)**.

   In other words, they don‚Äôt have their own data but they depend on other sources (like Yelp, Bing, Yahoo, and StackOverflow) to provide answers to users‚Äô questions

7. [Ask.com](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#ask)
   Formerly known as Ask Jeeves, [**Ask.com**](https://www.ask.com/) receives approximately 0.42% of the search share. ASK is based on a question/answer format where most questions are answered by other users or are in the form of polls.

   It also has the general search functionality but the results returned lack quality compared to Google or even Bing and Yahoo.

8. [Ecosia](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#ecosia)
   [**Ecosia**](https://www.ecosia.org/) is a Berlin-based social business founded by Christian Kroll in 2009. The main reason ecosia was created was to help in financing planting trees and restoration projects. It is thus known as the ‚Äútree planting search engine‚Äù.

   How does ecosia work? Ecosia is a Bing partner, meaning that its search results are powered by Bing. Ecosia makes money to support the planning of trees by displaying ads in their search results. Every time an ad is clicked, ecosia gets a small share. It is estimated that it takes approx 45 searches to finance the planting of one tree.

9. [Aol.com](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#aol)
   The old-time famous [**AOL**](https://www.aol.com/) is still in the top 10 search engines with a market share that is close to 0.05%.

   The AOL network includes many popular websites like engadget.com, techchrunch.com, and huffingtonpost.com. On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by Verizon Communications.

10. [Internet Archive](https://www.reliablesoft.net/top-10-search-engines-in-the-world/#archive)
    [**archive.org**](https://archive.org/) is the internet archive search engine. You can use it to find out how a web site looked since 1996. It is a very useful tool if you want to trace the history of a domain and examine how it has changed over the years.

## üìö Wiki Projects & Wikimedia Foundation (WMF)
### üå∫ WikiMedia Foundation (WMF)
> üîó https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation

The **Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.**, abbreviated **WMF**, is an American [501(c)(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3) "501(c)(3)") nonprofit organization headquartered in San Francisco, California, and registered there as a charitable foundation. It is the host of Wikipedia, the seventh [most visited website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites "List of most-visited websites") in the world. In addition, the foundation hosts 14 other related content projects. It supports the development of [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki "MediaWiki"), the wiki software that underpins them all.

The Wikimedia Foundation was established in 2003 in St. Petersburg, Florida by [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales "Jimmy Wales"), as a nonprofit way to fund [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia "Wikipedia"), [Wiktionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary "Wiktionary"), and other [crowdsourced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced "Crowdsourced") wiki projects. (Until then, they had been hosted by [Bomis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomis "Bomis"), Wales's for-profit company.) The Foundation finances itself mainly through millions of small donations from Wikipedia readers, collected through email campaigns and annual fundraising banners placed on Wikipedia and its sister projects. These are complemented by grants from philanthropic organizations and tech companies, and starting in 2022, by services income from [Wikimedia Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Enterprise "Wikimedia Enterprise").

The Foundation has grown rapidly throughout its existence. As of December 31, 2023, it has employed over 700 staff and contractors, with annual revenues of $180.2 million, annual expenses of $169 million, net assets of $255 million and a growing endowment, which surpassed $100 million in June 2021.

### üå∏ MediaWiki Software
üè† https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki

> üîó https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki#

**MediaWiki** is free and open-source wiki software originally developed by _Magnus Manske_ for use on Wikipedia on January 25, 2002, and further improved by _Lee Daniel Crocker_, after which it has been coordinated by the **Wikimedia Foundation**. It powers several wiki hosting websites across the Internet, as well as most websites hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation including **Wikipedia**, **Wiktionary**, **Wikimedia Commons**, **Wikiquote**, **Meta-Wiki** and **Wikidata**, which define a large part of the set requirements for the software. 

MediaWiki is written in the PHP programming language and stores all text content into a database. 
- The software is optimized to efficiently handle large projects, which can have terabytes of content and hundreds of thousands of views per second. Because Wikipedia is one of the world's largest and most visited websites, achieving scalability through multiple layers of caching and database replication has been a major concern for developers. 
- Another major aspect of MediaWiki is its internationalization; its interface is available in more than 400 languages. The software has more than 1,000 configuration settings and more than 1,800 extensions available for enabling various features to be added or changed.

Besides its usage on Wikimedia sites, MediaWiki has been used as a knowledge management and content management system on websites such as **Fandom**, **wikiHow** and major internal installations like **Intellipedia** and **Diplopedia**.
