This website is intended to be a source of knowledge for learning about and understandingÂ **antennas**. The goal is to present a comprehensive tutorial onÂ **antennas**. In the spirit of Einstein:

> "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."

This website will strive to makeÂ **antennas**Â understandable, without unnecessary complexity.



## Intro

A person, who needs to convey a thought, an idea or a doubt, can do so byÂ **voice communication**.

The following illustration shows two individuals communicating with each other. Here, communication takes place throughÂ **sound waves**. However, if two people want to communicate who are at longer distances, then we have to convert these sound waves intoÂ **electromagnetic waves**. The device, which converts the required information signal into electromagnetic waves, is known as anÂ **Antenna**.

An Antenna is a transducer, which converts electrical power into electromagnetic waves and vice versa.

An Antenna can be used either as aÂ **transmitting antenna**Â or aÂ **receiving antenna**.
- AÂ **transmitting antenna**Â is one, which converts electrical signals into electromagnetic waves and radiates them.
- AÂ **receiving antenna**Â is one, which converts electromagnetic waves from the received beam into electrical signals.
- In two-way communication, the same antenna can be used for both transmission and reception.

Antenna can also be termed as anÂ **Aerial**. Plural of it is,Â **antennae**Â orÂ **antennas**. Nowadays, antennas have undergone many changes, in accordance with their size and shape. There are many types of antennas depending upon their wide variety of applications.
