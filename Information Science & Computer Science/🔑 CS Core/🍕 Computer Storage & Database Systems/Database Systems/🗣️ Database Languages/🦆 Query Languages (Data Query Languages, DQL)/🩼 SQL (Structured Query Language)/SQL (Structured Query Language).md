- Oracle : PL/SQL
- Microsoft: T-SQL



## Intro
> An international standard now exists for the SQL language making it both the formal and de facto standard language for defining and manipulating relational databases (ISO, 1992, 2011a).

An international standard now exists for the SQL language making it both the formal and de facto standard language for defining and manipulating relational databases (ISO, 1992, 2011a).

SQL is an example of a **transform-oriented language**, or a language designed to use relations to transform inputs into required outputs. As a language, the ISO SQL standard has two major components:
- a **Data Definition Language (DDL)** for defining the database structure and controlling access to the data;
- a **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** for retrieving and updating data.


### History of SQL
↗ [History & Development of SQL](History%20&%20Development%20of%20SQL.md)


### Terminology
The **ISO SQL standard** does not use the formal terms of <span style="color:red">relations, attributes, and tuples</span>, instead using the terms <span style="color:blue">tables, columns, and rows</span>. In our presentation of SQL we mostly use the ISO terminology.

It should also be noted that SQL does not adhere strictly to the definition of the relational model described before. For example, SQL allows the table produced as the result of the SELECT statement to contain duplicate rows, it imposes an ordering on the columns, and it allows the user to order the rows of a result table.


### Importance of SQL
SQL is the first and, so far, only standard database language to gain wide acceptance. 

> The only other standard database language, the **Network Database Language (NDL)**, based on the **CODASYL network model**, has few followers. 

Nearly every major current vendor provides database products based on SQL or with an SQL interface, and most are represented on at least one of the standard-making bodies. There is a huge investment in the SQL language both by vendors and by users. It has become part of application architectures such as IBM’s **Systems Application Architecture (SAA)** and is the strategic choice of many large and influential organizations, for example, the Open Group consortium for UNIX standards. 

SQL has also become a **Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)** to which conformance is required for all sales of DBMSs to the U.S. government. The SQL Access Group, a consortium of vendors, defined a set of enhancements to SQL that would support interoperability across disparate systems.
SQL is used in other standards and even influences the development of other standards as a definitional tool. Examples include ISO’s **Information Resource Dictionary System (IRDS)** standard and **Remote Data Access (RDA) standard**. The development of the language is supported by considerable academic interest, providing both a theoretical basis for the language and the techniques needed to implement it successfully. This is especially true in query optimization, distribution of data, and security. There are now specialized implementations of SQL that are directed at new markets, such as **OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP)**.


### SQL Statements & Syntex & Notations
1️⃣ An SQL statement consists of **reserved words** and **user-defined words.** 
- **Reserved words** are a fixed part of the SQL language and have a fixed meaning. They must be spelled exactly as required and cannot be split across lines.
- **User-defined words** are made up by the user (according to certain syntax rules) and represent the names of various database objects such as tables, columns, views, indexes, and so on.

2️⃣ The words in a statement are also built according to a set of syntax rules.

3️⃣ Although the standard does not require it, many dialects of SQL require the use of a **statement terminator** to mark the end of each SQL statement (usually the semicolon “;” is used).

4️⃣ Most components of an SQL statement are **case-insensitive**, which means that letters can be typed in either upper- or lowercase. 

> ❗ The one important exception to this rule is that literal character data must be typed exactly as it appears in the database. For example, if we store a person’s surname as “SMITH” and then search for it using the string “Smith,” the row will not be found.

5️⃣ Although SQL is **free-format**, an SQL statement or set of statements is more readable if **indentation** and **lineation** are used. For example:
- each clause in a statement should begin on a new line;
- the beginning of each clause should line up with the beginning of other clauses;
- if a clause has several parts, they should each appear on a separate line and be indented under the start of the clause to show the relationship.

6️⃣ Throughout this and the next three chapters, we use the following **extended form of the Backus Naur Form (BNF) notation** to define SQL statements:
- uppercase letters are used to represent reserved words and must be spelled exactly as shown;
- lowercase letters are used to represent user-defined words;
- a vertical bar ( | ) indicates a choice among alternatives; for example, a | b | c;
- curly braces indicate a required element; for example, {a};
- square brackets indicate an optional element; for example, [a];
- an ellipsis(...) is used to indicate optional repetition of an item zero or more times.
	- For example: {a|b} (, c . . .) means either a or b followed by zero or more repetitions of c separated by commas.
