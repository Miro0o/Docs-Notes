## Intro
This section looks at the following SQL DML statements:
- **SELECT** – to query data in the database
- **INSERT** – to insert data into a table  
- **UPDATE** – to update data in a table  
- **DELETE** – to delete data from a table


### Literals (SQL常量)
Before we discuss the SQL DML statements, it is necessary to understand the concept of literals. **Literals are constants that are used in SQL statements**. There are different forms of literals for every data type supported by SQL (see Section 7.1.1). However, for simplicity, we can distinguish between literals that are enclosed in **single quotes** and those that are not. 

All nonnumeric data values must be enclosed in single quotes; all numeric data values must not be enclosed in single quotes
