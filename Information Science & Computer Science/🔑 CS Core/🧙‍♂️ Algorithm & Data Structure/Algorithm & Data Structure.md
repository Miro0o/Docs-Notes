[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), an **algorithm** ([/ˈælɡərɪðəm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/7/7f/En-us-algorithm.ogg/En-us-algorithm.ogg.mp3 "Play audio")[ⓘ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:En-us-algorithm.ogg "File:En-us-algorithm.ogg")) is a finite sequence of [mathematically rigorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigour#Mathematics "Rigour") instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific [problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem "Computational problem") or to perform a [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation"). Algorithms are used as specifications for performing [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation "Calculation") and [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing"). More advanced algorithms can use [conditionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_\(computer_programming\) "Conditional (computer programming)") to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as [automated decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_decision-making "Automated decision-making")) and deduce valid [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference") (referred to as [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning "Automated reasoning")).

In contrast, a [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_\(computer_science\) "Heuristic (computer science)") is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results. For example, although social media [recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system "Recommender system") are commonly called "algorithms", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly "correct" recommendation.

As an [effective method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method "Effective method"), an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language") for calculating a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_\(mathematics\) "Function (mathematics)"). Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [empty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_string "Empty string")), the instructions describe a computation that, when [executed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_\(computing\) "Execution (computing)"), proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic "Deterministic"); some algorithms, known as [randomized algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm "Randomized algorithm"), incorporate random input.


### Etymology of "Algorithm"
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm

Around 825 AD, Persian scientist and polymath [Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi "Al-Khwarizmi") wrote _kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī_ ("Book of Indian computation") and _kitab al-jam' wa'l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī_ ("Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic"). In the early 12th century, Latin translations of these texts involving the [Hindu–Arabic numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system "Hindu–Arabic numeral system") and [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") appeared, for example _Liber Alghoarismi de practica arismetrice_, attributed to [John of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Seville "John of Seville"), and _Liber Algorismi de numero Indorum_, attributed to [Adelard of Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelard_of_Bath "Adelard of Bath"). Here, _alghoarismi_ or _algorismi_ is the [Latinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_of_names "Latinisation of names") of Al-Khwarizmi's name; the text starts with the phrase _Dixit Algorismi_, or "Thus spoke Al-Khwarizmi".

The word _[algorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorism "Algorism")_ in English came to mean the use of place-value notation in calculations; it occurs in the _[Ancrene Wisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancrene_Wisse "Ancrene Wisse")_ from circa 1225. By the time [Geoffrey Chaucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer "Geoffrey Chaucer") wrote _[The Canterbury Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales "The Canterbury Tales")_ in the late 14th century, he used a variant of the same word in describing _augrym stones_, stones used for place-value calculation. In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός (_arithmos_, "number"; _cf._ "arithmetic"), the Latin word was altered to _algorithmus_. By 1596, this form of the word was used in English, as _algorithm_, by [Thomas Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hood_\(mathematician\) "Thomas Hood (mathematician)").
