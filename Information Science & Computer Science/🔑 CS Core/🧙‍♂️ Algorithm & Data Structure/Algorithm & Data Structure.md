[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.  
  
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

🚧 https://github.com/algorithmica-org/algorithmica
- This is an upcoming high performance computing book titled “Algorithms for Modern Hardware” by [Sergey Slotin](http://sereja.me/).
- Its intended audience is everyone from performance engineers and practical algorithm researchers to undergraduate computer science students who have just finished an advanced algorithms course and want to learn more practical ways to speed up a program than by going from $O(n\log{n})$ to $O(n\log⁡{\log⁡{n}})$.

📖 Algorithms 4th Edition
by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne | https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
- book contents
	- [_Chapter 1: Fundamentals_](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/10fundamentals) introduces a scientific and engineering basis for comparing algorithms and making predictions. It also includes our programming model.
	- [_Chapter 2: Sorting_](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/20sorting) considers several classic sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, mergesort, and quicksort. It also features a binary heap implementation of a priority queue.
	- [_Chapter 3: Searching_](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/30searching) describes several classic symbol-table implementations, including binary search trees, red–black trees, and hash tables.
	- [_Chapter 4: Graphs_](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/40graphs) surveys the most important graph-processing problems, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, minimum spanning trees, and shortest paths.
	- [_Chapter 5: Strings_](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/50strings) investigates specialized algorithms for string processing, including radix sorting, substring search, tries, regular expressions, and data compression.
	- [_Chapter 6: Context_](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/60context) highlights connections to systems programming, scientific computing, commercial applications, operations research, and intractability.
