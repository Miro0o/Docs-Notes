[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.  
  
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

-  Our textbook _Introduction to Programming in Java_ [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2BLKP69) · [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Sedgewick-Introduction-to-Programming-in-Java-An-Interdisciplinary-Approach-2nd-Edition/PGM334823.html) · [InformIT](https://www.informit.com/store/computer-science-an-interdisciplinary-approach-9780134076478)  is an interdisciplinary approach to the traditional CS1 curriculum with Java. We teach the classic elements of programming, using an “objects-in-the-middle” approach that emphasizes data abstraction. We motivate each concept by examining its impact on specific applications, taken from fields ranging from materials science to genomics to astrophysics to internet commerce. The book is organized around four stages of learning to program:
	- [_Chapter 1: Elements of Programming_](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/10elements) introduces variables; assignment statements; built-in types of data; conditionals and loops; arrays; and input/output, including graphics and sound.
	- [_Chapter 2: Functions_](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/20functions) highlights the idea of dividing a program into components that can be independently debugged, maintained, and reused.
	- [_Chapter 3: Object-Oriented Programming_](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/30oop) emphasizes the concept of a data type and its implementation, using Java's class mechanism.
	- [_Chapter 4: Algorithms and Data Structures_](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/40algorithms) discusses classical algorithms for sorting and searching, and fundamental data structures, including stacks, queues, and symbol tables.

	- [_Chapter 5: Theory of Computing_](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/50theory) surveys the fundamental concepts of universality, computability, and intractability, which raise questions about the role of computation in understanding the natural world.
	- [_Chapter 6: A Computing Machine_](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/60machine) describes a simple imaginary machine that has many of the characteristics of real processors at the heart of the computational devices that surround us.
	- [_Chapter 7: Building a Computer_](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/70circuits) considers the design of a processor, including Boolean logic, combinational circuits, and sequential circuits.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), an **algorithm** ([/ˈælɡərɪðəm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/7/7f/En-us-algorithm.ogg/En-us-algorithm.ogg.mp3 "Play audio")[ⓘ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:En-us-algorithm.ogg "File:En-us-algorithm.ogg")) is a finite sequence of [mathematically rigorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigour#Mathematics "Rigour") instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific [problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem "Computational problem") or to perform a [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation"). Algorithms are used as specifications for performing [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation "Calculation") and [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing"). More advanced algorithms can use [conditionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_\(computer_programming\) "Conditional (computer programming)") to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as [automated decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_decision-making "Automated decision-making")) and deduce valid [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference") (referred to as [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning "Automated reasoning")).

In contrast, a [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_\(computer_science\) "Heuristic (computer science)") is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results. For example, although social media [recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system "Recommender system") are commonly called "algorithms", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly "correct" recommendation.

As an [effective method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method "Effective method"), an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language") for calculating a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_\(mathematics\) "Function (mathematics)"). Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [empty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_string "Empty string")), the instructions describe a computation that, when [executed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_\(computing\) "Execution (computing)"), proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic "Deterministic"); some algorithms, known as [randomized algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm "Randomized algorithm"), incorporate random input.


### Etymology
Around 825 AD, Persian scientist and polymath [Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi "Al-Khwarizmi") wrote _kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī_ ("Book of Indian computation") and _kitab al-jam' wa'l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī_ ("Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic"). In the early 12th century, Latin translations of these texts involving the [Hindu–Arabic numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system "Hindu–Arabic numeral system") and [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") appeared, for example _Liber Alghoarismi de practica arismetrice_, attributed to [John of Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Seville "John of Seville"), and _Liber Algorismi de numero Indorum_, attributed to [Adelard of Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelard_of_Bath "Adelard of Bath"). Here, _alghoarismi_ or _algorismi_ is the [Latinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_of_names "Latinisation of names") of Al-Khwarizmi's name; the text starts with the phrase _Dixit Algorismi_, or "Thus spoke Al-Khwarizmi".

The word _[algorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorism "Algorism")_ in English came to mean the use of place-value notation in calculations; it occurs in the _[Ancrene Wisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancrene_Wisse "Ancrene Wisse")_ from circa 1225. By the time [Geoffrey Chaucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer "Geoffrey Chaucer") wrote _[The Canterbury Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales "The Canterbury Tales")_ in the late 14th century, he used a variant of the same word in describing _augrym stones_, stones used for place-value calculation. In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός (_arithmos_, "number"; _cf._ "arithmetic"), the Latin word was altered to _algorithmus_. By 1596, this form of the word was used in English, as _algorithm_, by [Thomas Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hood_\(mathematician\) "Thomas Hood (mathematician)").
