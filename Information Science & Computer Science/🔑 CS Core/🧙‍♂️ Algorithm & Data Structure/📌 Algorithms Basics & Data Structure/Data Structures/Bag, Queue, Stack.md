Several fundamental data types involve collections of objects. Specifically, the set of values is a collection of objects, and the operations revolve around adding, removing, or examining objects in the collection. In this section, we consider three such data types, known as the bag, the queue, and the stack. They differ in the specification of which object is to be removed or examined next.

Bags, queues, and stacks are fundamental and broadly useful. We use them in implementations throughout the book. Beyond this direct applicability, the client and implementation code in this section serves as an introduction to our general approach to the development of data structures and algorithms.

### Stack

#### Stack Segment /Stack Frame
A stack frame is a data structure used to keep track of information about a subroutine call, while a stack segment is a segment of memory used by the operating system to store the call stack.

> 🔗 [Data Segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment)
> The stack segment **contains the call stack, a LIFO structure, typically located in the higher parts of memory**. A "stack pointer" register tracks the top of the stack; it is adjusted each time a value is "pushed" onto the stack. The set of values pushed for one function call is termed a "stack frame".

>  🔗 [Stack-Based Memory Allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation)
>  If a region of memory lies on the thread's stack, that memory is said to have been allocated on the stack, i.e. stack-based memory allocation (SBMA). This is contrasted with a [heap-based memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap-based_memory_allocation "Heap-based memory allocation") (HBMA). The SBMA is often closely coupled with a [function call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#Functions_of_the_call_stack "Call stack").
