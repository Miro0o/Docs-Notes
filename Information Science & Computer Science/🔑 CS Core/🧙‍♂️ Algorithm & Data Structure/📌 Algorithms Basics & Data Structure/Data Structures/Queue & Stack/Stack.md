## Intro
### Stack Segment /Stack Frame
A stack frame is a data structure used to keep track of information about a subroutine call, while a stack segment is a segment of memory used by the operating system to store the call stack.

> The stack segment **contains the call stack, a LIFO structure, typically located in the higher parts of memory**. A "stack pointer" register tracks the top of the stack; it is adjusted each time a value is "pushed" onto the stack. The set of values pushed for one function call is termed a "stack frame".

>  🔗 [Stack-Based Memory Allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation)
>  If a region of memory lies on the thread's stack, that memory is said to have been allocated on the stack, i.e. stack-based memory allocation (SBMA). This is contrasted with a [heap-based memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap-based_memory_allocation "Heap-based memory allocation") (HBMA). The SBMA is often closely coupled with a [function call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#Functions_of_the_call_stack "Call stack").
