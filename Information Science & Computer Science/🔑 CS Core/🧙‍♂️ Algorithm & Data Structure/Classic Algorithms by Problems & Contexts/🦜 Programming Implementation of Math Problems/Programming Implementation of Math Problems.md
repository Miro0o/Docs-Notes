👍 [Algorithms for Competitive Programming](https://cp-algorithms.com/index.html)

The goal of this project is to translate the wonderful resource [http://e-maxx.ru/algo](http://e-maxx.ru/algo) which provides descriptions of many algorithms and data structures especially popular in field of competitive programming. Moreover we want to improve the collected knowledge by extending the articles and adding new articles to the collection.

Compiled pages are published at [https://cp-algorithms.com/](https://cp-algorithms.com/).

本章介绍 OI 中可能会用到的数学知识。计算机科学与数学紧密相关，而在算法竞赛中尤其强调以数论、排列组合、概率期望、多项式为代表离散、具体的数学：其注重程序实现和现实问题，可以出现在几乎任何类别的题目中。
