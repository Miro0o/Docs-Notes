| **BMP**, pronounced "bee-em-pee" or "bump," is the native bitmap graphics file format of the Microsoft Windows environment. Microsoft Paint, included as part of Microsoft Windows, creates BMP graphics files, as well as PNGs and JPEGs. The BMP format supports True Color and can be used for a wide variety of graphics applications, such as photographs, illustrations, and graphs. BMP files are often too large for email attachments. Their size makes BMPs undesirable for use on Web pages.                                                                         | Graphical elements, such as buttons and other controls for graphical user interfaces                 |
| **RAW** image formats contain the unprocessed pixel data generated directly by a digital camera's sensor. Up to 12 bits of data can be stored for each of the red, blue, and green values for a pixel, so RAW files are very large. Cameras that offer a RAW format usually supply software to convert RAW data to smaller JPEG or TIFF files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Photographic images before they are stored in other formats                                          |
| **TIFF** (Tagged Image File Format), or TIF, is a flexible and platform-independent graphics file format supported by most photoediting software packages. Scanners and digital cameras commonly store bitmaps in TIFF format because it supports True Color and can be easily converted into other graphics file formats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Desktop publishing and any projects that require high-resolution graphics; not supported by browsers |
| **JPEG** (pronounced "JAY-peg"), which stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, is a graphics format with built-in compression that stores True Color bitmap data very efficiently in a small file. The JPEG format is popular for Web graphics, smartphone photos, and for photos attached to email messages. When creating a JPEG or converting an image to JPEG format, you can control the level of compression and the resulting file size. The compression process eliminates some image data, however, so highly compressed files suffer some quality deterioration. | General use, such as desktop publishing or Web pages, where flexibility in file size is important    |
| **GIF** (Graphics Interchange Format), pronounced "gif" or "jiff," was specifically designed to create images that can be displayed on multiple platforms, such as PCs and Macs. GIF graphics are limited to 256 colors, but the format supports simple animations. Once a popular format for Web pages, GIF is being replaced by JPEG and PNG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Web graphics and simple animations                                                                   |
| **PNG** (Portable Network Graphics), pronounced "ping," is a graphics format designed to improve on the GIF format. A PNG graphic can display up to 48-bit True Color (trillions of colors). Unlike JPEG, PNG compresses bitmap files without losing any data, so compressed images retain the same high quality as the originals. PNG was developed as a public domain format without any restrictions on its use.                                                                                                                                                             | Web graphics and other general uses                                                                  |
