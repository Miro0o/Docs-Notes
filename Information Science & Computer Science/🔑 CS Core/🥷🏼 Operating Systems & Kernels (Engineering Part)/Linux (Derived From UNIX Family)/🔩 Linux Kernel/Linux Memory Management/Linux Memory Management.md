Linux memory management is a complex subsystem that deals with:
- Management of the physical memory: allocating and freeing memory
- Management of the virtual memory: paging, swapping, demand paging, copy on write
- User services: user address space management (e.g. mmap(), brk(), shared memory)
- Kernel services: SL*B allocators, vmalloc
