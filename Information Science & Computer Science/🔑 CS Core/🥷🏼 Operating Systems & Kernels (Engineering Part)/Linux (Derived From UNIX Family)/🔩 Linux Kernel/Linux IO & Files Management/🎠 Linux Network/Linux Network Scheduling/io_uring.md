## Intro

`io_uring`Â is a (new as of mid 2019) Linux kernel interface to efficiently allow you to send and receive data asynchronously. It was originally designed to target block devices and files but has since gained the ability to work with things like network sockets.

Unlike something likeÂ `epoll()`, it is built around a completion model rather than a readiness model. This is desirable because other operating systems have used the completion model successfully for some time.Â `io_uring`Â provides something competitive and complete for Linux without theÂ [drawbacks the previous Linux AIO interface has](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46377629/2732969).

The author ofÂ `io_uring`Â has written a PDF document titledÂ [Efficient IO with io_uring](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf)Â which discusses its usage in a technical fashion. A gentler introduction is provided by theÂ [Lord of the io_uring](https://unixism.net/loti/)Â guide. You can read ScyllaDB developer Glauber Costa proselytize it inÂ [How io_uring and eBPF Will Revolutionize Programming in Linux](https://www.scylladb.com/2020/05/05/how-io_uring-and-ebpf-will-revolutionize-programming-in-linux/). Lastly,Â [LWN.net has written aboutÂ `io_uring`Â many times](https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/#io_uring).

(Shameless plug: I've written a more linkyÂ [answer on the "Is there really no asynchronous block I/O on Linux?"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57451551/2732969)Â question)
