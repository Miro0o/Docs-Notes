## Intro
LTP provides tools and testsuites to verify the Linux kernel and related subsystems

Linux Test Project is a joint project started by SGI, OSDL and Bull developed and maintained by SUSE, Red Hat, Fujitsu, IBM, Cisco, Oracle and others. The project goal is to deliver tests to the open source community that validate reliability, robustness, and stability of the Linux Kernel.

The testing suites contain a collection of tools for testing the Linux kernel and related features. Our goal is to improve the Linux kernel and system libraries by bringing test automation.

> Warning
> LTP tests shouldn't run in production systems. In particular, growfiles, doio, and iogen, stress the I/O capabilities of the systems and they are intended to find (or cause) problems.
