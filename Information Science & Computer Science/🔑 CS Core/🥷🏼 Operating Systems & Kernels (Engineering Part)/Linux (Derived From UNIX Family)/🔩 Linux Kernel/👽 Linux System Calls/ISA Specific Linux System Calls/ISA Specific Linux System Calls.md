Linux provides many system calls for userspace. But numbers used for them differ between architectures. This page was created to help developers find those values.

But there is another issue. Some of system calls got dropped during Linux development, some got replaced by newer ones. Several architectures got added into kernel later and their maintainers decided to not bother with supporting obsoleted system calls. They are marked with "-1" value in table below.
