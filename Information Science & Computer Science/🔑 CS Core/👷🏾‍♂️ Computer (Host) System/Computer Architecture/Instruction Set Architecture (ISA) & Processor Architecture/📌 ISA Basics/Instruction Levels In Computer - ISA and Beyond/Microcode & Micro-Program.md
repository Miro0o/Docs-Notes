## Intro
> ðŸ”— [Microcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode "Microcode")

InÂ processor design,Â **microcode**Â serves as an intermediary layer situated between theÂ central processing unitÂ (CPU) hardware and the programmer-visibleÂ instruction set architectureÂ of a computer.Â It consists of a set of hardware-level instructions that implement higher-levelÂ [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code")Â instructions or control internalÂ [finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine "Finite-state machine")Â sequencing in manyÂ digital processing components. While microcode is utilized in general-purpose CPUs in contemporary desktops, it also functions as a fallback path for scenarios that the fasterÂ [hardwired control unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwired_control_unit "Hardwired control unit")Â is unable to manage.

Housed in special high-speed memory, microcode translates machine instructions,Â [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine "State machine")Â data, or other input into sequences of detailed circuit-level operations. It separates the machine instructions from the underlyingÂ [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"), thereby enabling greater flexibility in designing and altering instructions. Moreover, it facilitates the construction of complex multi-step instructions, while simultaneously reducing the complexity of computer circuits.

> The act of writing microcode is often referred to asÂ **microprogramming**, and the microcode in a specific processor implementation is sometimes termed aÂ **microprogram**.
> Accordingly, the instructions consists of a microcode or microprogram is termed **microinstruction**

Through extensive microprograming,Â [microarchitectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture "Microarchitecture")Â of smaller scale and simplicity canÂ [emulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator "Emulator")Â more robust architectures with widerÂ [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture) "Word (computer architecture)")Â lengths, additionalÂ [execution units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_unit "Execution unit"), and so forth. This approach provides a relatively straightforward method of ensuring software compatibility between different products within a processor family.

Some hardware vendors, notablyÂ [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM")/[Lenovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo "Lenovo"), use the termÂ microcode interchangeably withÂ [firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware "Firmware"). In this context, all code within a device is termed microcode, whether it is microcode or machine code. For instance, updates to aÂ [hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive "Hard disk drive")'s microcode often encompass updates to both its microcode and firmware
