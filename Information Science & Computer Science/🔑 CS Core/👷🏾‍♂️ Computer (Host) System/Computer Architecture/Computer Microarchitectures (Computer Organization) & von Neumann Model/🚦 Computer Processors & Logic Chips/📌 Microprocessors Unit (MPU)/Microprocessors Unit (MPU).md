### CPU

### GPU
#### TPU
> ðŸ”— https://www.kaggle.com/general/221800
> 
> - **Tensor Processing Unit abbreviation TPU** is a custom-built integrated circuit developed specifically for machine learning and tailored for TensorFlow, Google's open-source machine learning framework. TPUâ€™s have been powering Google data centers since 2015, however Google still uses CPUs and GPUs for other types of machine learning.  
> - TPU can handleÂ **upto 128000 operations**Â per cycle  
> - A co-processor designed to accelerate deep learning tasks develop using TensorFlow (a programming framework); Compilers have not been developed for TPU which could be used for general purpose programming; hence, it requires significant effort to do general programming on TPU

### DSP
AÂ **digital signal processor**Â (**DSP**) is a specializedÂ microprocessorÂ chip, with its architecture optimized for the operational needs ofÂ [digital signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing "Digital signal processing").

DSPs areÂ fabricatedÂ onÂ [MOS integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit")Â chips.

DSPs are widely used inÂ [audio signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_processing "Audio signal processing"),Â [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications "Telecommunications"),Â [digital image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing "Digital image processing"),Â [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar"),Â [sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar "Sonar")andÂ [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition")Â systems, and in commonÂ [consumer electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronic "Consumer electronic")Â devices such asÂ [mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones "Mobile phones"),Â [disk drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_drives "Disk drives")Â andÂ [high-definition television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television "High-definition television")Â (HDTV) products.
