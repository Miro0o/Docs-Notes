## Intro
### (Device) Controller
> Controller is the hardware part of controlling a device. The software counterparts come as a ↗ [Device Driver](../../../../Computer%20Interfaces%20&%20Hardware%20Drivers/🛞%20Computer%20(IO%20Devices)%20Drivers%20&%20Programming/Computer%20(IO%20Devices)%20Drivers%20&%20Programming.md)

> 🔗 https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_controller

A device controller is a system that handles the incoming and outgoing signals of the CPU by acting as a bridge between CPU and the I/O devices. **A device is connected to the computer via a plug and socket, and the socket is connect to a device controller**. Device controllers use binary and digital codes. An IO device contains mechanical and electrical parts. A device controller is the electrical part of the IO device.

### Expansion Card /Adapter Card
> An expansion card contains a device controller, because the card (a PCB) is considered a device itself. However, a device controller can exists in other kinds of devices /interfaces as well, like a USB controller.
> 
> An expansion card comes with its own interface and bus.

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), an **expansion card** (also called an **expansion board**, **adapter card**, **peripheral card** or **accessory card**) is a [printed circuit board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board "Printed circuit board") that can be inserted into an [electrical connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_connector "Electrical connector"), or **expansion slot** (also referred to as a bus slot) on a computer's [motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard "Motherboard") (see also [backplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane "Backplane")) to add functionality to a computer system. Sometimes the design of the computer's case and motherboard involves placing most (or all) of these slots onto a separate, removable card. Typically such cards are referred to as a [riser card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riser_card "Riser card") in part because they project upward from the board and allow expansion cards to be placed above and parallel to the motherboard.

Expansion cards allow the capabilities and interfaces of a computer system to be extended or supplemented in a way appropriate to the tasks it will perform. For example, a high-speed multi-channel data acquisition system would be of no use in a personal computer used for bookkeeping, but might be a key part of a system used for industrial process control. Expansion cards can often be installed or removed in the field, allowing a degree of user customization for particular purposes. Some expansion cards take the form of "daughterboards" that plug into connectors on a supporting system board.
