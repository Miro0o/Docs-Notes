InÂ [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture), aÂ **local bus**Â is aÂ [computer bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_bus "Computer bus")Â that connects directly, or almost directly, from theÂ [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit")Â (CPU) to one or more slots on theÂ [expansion bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_bus "Expansion bus"). The significance of direct connection to the CPU is avoiding theÂ [bottleneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottleneck_\(engineering\) "Bottleneck (engineering)")Â created by the expansion bus, thus providing fastÂ [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput "Throughput"). There are several local buses built into various types of computers to increase the speed of data transfer (i.e.Â [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_\(computing\) "Bandwidth (computing)")). Local buses for expanded memory and video boards are the most common.Â [VESA Local Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_Local_Bus "VESA Local Bus")Â andÂ [Processor Direct Slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_Direct_Slot "Processor Direct Slot")Â were examples of a local bus design.

Although VL-Bus was later succeeded byÂ [AGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Graphics_Port "Accelerated Graphics Port"), it is not correct to categorize AGP as a local bus. Whereas VL-Bus operated on the CPU'sÂ [memory bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_bus "Memory bus")Â at the CPU's clock speed, an AGP peripheral runs at specified clock speeds that run independently of the CPU clock (usually using a divider of the CPU clock).
