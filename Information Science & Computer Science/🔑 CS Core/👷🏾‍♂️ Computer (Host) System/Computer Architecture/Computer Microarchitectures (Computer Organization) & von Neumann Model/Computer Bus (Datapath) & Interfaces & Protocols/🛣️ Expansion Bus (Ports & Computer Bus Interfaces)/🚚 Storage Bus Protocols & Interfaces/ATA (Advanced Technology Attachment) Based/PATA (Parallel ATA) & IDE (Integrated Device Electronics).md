**Parallel ATA** (**PATA**), originally **AT Attachment**, also known as **Integrated Drive Electronics** (**IDE**), is a [standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization "Standardization") [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_\(computing\) "Interface (computing)") designed for [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC "IBM PC")-compatible computers. It was first developed by [Western Digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Digital "Western Digital") and [Compaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq "Compaq") in 1986 for compatible hard drives and CD or DVD drives. The connection is used for [computer storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_storage "Computer storage") such as [hard disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive "Hard disk drive"), [floppy disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk_variants#Superfloppy "Floppy disk variants"), [optical disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_drive "Optical disc drive"), and [tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_drive "Tape drive").

The standard is maintained by the X3/[INCITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INCITS "INCITS") committee. It uses the underlying AT Attachment (ATA) and AT Attachment Packet Interface ([ATAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATA_Packet_Interface "ATA Packet Interface")) standards.

The Parallel ATA standard is the result of a long history of incremental technical development, which began with the original AT Attachment interface, developed for use in early [PC AT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_AT "PC AT") equipment. The ATA interface itself evolved in several stages from [Western Digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Digital "Western Digital")'s original [Integrated Drive Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Drive_Electronics "Integrated Drive Electronics") (IDE) interface. As a result, many near-synonyms for ATA/ATAPI and its previous incarnations are still in common informal use, in particular Extended IDE (EIDE) and Ultra ATA (UATA). After the introduction of [SATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA "SATA") in 2003, the original ATA was [renamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retronym "Retronym") to Parallel ATA, or PATA for short.

Parallel ATA cables have a maximum allowable length of 18 in (457 mm). Because of this limit, the technology normally appears as an internal computer storage interface. For many years, ATA provided the most common and the least expensive interface for this application. It has largely been replaced by SATA in newer systems.
