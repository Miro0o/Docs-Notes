TheÂ **Power Management Bus**Â (PMBus) is a variant of theÂ [System Management Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Bus "System Management Bus")Â (SMBus) which is targeted at digital management ofÂ [power supplies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_power_supply "Computer power supply"). Like SMBus, it is a relatively slow speed two wireÂ [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol")Â based onÂ [IÂ²C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C "IÂ²C"). Unlike either of those standards, it defines a substantial number of domain-specific commands rather than just saying how to communicate using commands defined by the user.
