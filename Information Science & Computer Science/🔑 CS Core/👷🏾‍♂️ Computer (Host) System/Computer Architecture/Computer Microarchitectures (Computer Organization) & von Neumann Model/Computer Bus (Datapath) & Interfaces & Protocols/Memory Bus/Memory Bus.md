## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)#Memory_bus

The _memory bus_ is the bus that connects the [main memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_memory "Main memory") to the [memory controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_controller "Memory controller") in computer systems. Originally, general-purpose buses like [VMEbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMEbus "VMEbus") and the [S-100 bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_bus) were used, but to reduce [latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_\(engineering\) "Latency (engineering)"), modern memory buses are designed to connect directly to DRAM chips, and thus are defined by chip standards bodies such as [JEDEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC "JEDEC"). Examples are the various generations of [SDRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDRAM "SDRAM"), and serial point-to-point buses like [SLDRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLDRAM "SLDRAM") and [RDRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDRAM "RDRAM").
