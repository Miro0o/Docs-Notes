We have various [forums](https://doc.coreboot.org/community/forums.html) where we discuss and coordinate our activities, review patches, and help out each other.

Every now and then, coreboot is present in one way or another at [conferences](https://doc.coreboot.org/community/conferences.html). If you’re around, come and say hello!
