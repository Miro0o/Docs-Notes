## Intro
> 📎 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS

The **Zettabyte File System** (ZFS™) was developed by Sun Microsystems™ in 2006 to solve the data integrity and protection issues other file systems faced. After Oracle™ acquired Sun, some of the original ZFS engineers founded the OpenZFS™ project to provide continued, collaborative development of the Open Source version.

ZFS (previously: Zettabyte File System) is a file system with volume management capabilities. It began as part of the Sun Microsystems Solaris operating system in 2001. Large parts of Solaris, including ZFS, were published under an open source license as OpenSolaris for around 5 years from 2005 before being placed under a closed source license when Oracle Corporation acquired Sun in 2009–2010. During 2005 to 2010, the open source version of ZFS was ported to Linux, Mac OS X (continued as MacZFS) and FreeBSD. In 2010, the illumos project forked a recent version of OpenSolaris, including ZFS, to continue its development as an open source project. In 2013, OpenZFS was founded to coordinate the development of open source ZFS. OpenZFS maintains and manages the core ZFS code, while organizations using ZFS maintain the specific code and validation processes required for ZFS to integrate within their systems. OpenZFS is widely used in Unix-like systems
