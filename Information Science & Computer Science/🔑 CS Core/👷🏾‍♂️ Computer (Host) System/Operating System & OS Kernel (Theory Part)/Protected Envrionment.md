### LPARs (Logical Partitions)
- ﻿﻿In very large computers, subsystems do not go far enough to establish a protected environment. Sometimes a more sophisticated barrier is required to facilitate security and resource management.
- ﻿﻿Logical partitions (LPARs) provide much higher barriers: Processes running within a logical partition have no access to processes running in another partition unless a connection between them (e.g., FTP) is explicitly established.
- ﻿﻿LPARs create distinct machines within one physical system, with nothing implicitly shared between them.
