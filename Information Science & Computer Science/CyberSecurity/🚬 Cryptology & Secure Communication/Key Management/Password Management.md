### Password 🆚 Cryptographic Key

### Password Sucks! What are Alternatives?
- There is broad understanding that passwords have many problems: users choose guessable passwords, they reuse them on many sites, and users can be tricked into revealing their password (phishing emails, fake websites)
- Why are passwords still so widely used?  They are easy for users to understand, familiar, and don't lock users into a particular device or technology
	- If I drop my phone in the ocean, can I still get into my accounts?
- Nonetheless, the tech community is developing better alternatives

Alternatives:
- **Password managers**: your browser remembers and syncs your passwords, so you can feel free to choose hard-to-guess passwords
- **Email-based authentication**: the website emails you a magic link to log in
- **Two-factor authentication**: you must provide both a password, and also authorize the login on an app on your phone
- **Passkeys**: store a personal private key on your phone, server remembers your public key, uses public-key signatures + encryption to authenticate you; private key is often stored and protected with special hardware
