## Intro
The recon-ng framework is an open source framework for conducting reconnaissance (passive and active). The framework is similar to **Metasploit** and **Social Engineer Toolkit** (**SET**); recon-ng uses a very modular framework. Each module is a customized command interpreter, preconfigured to perform a specific task.
