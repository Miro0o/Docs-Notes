## Intro
ZGrab is a stateful application-layer scanner. ZGrab is written in Go and supports HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, Telnet, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, Modbus, BACNET, Siemens S7, and Tridium Fox. For example, ZGrab can perform a TLS connection and collect the root HTTP page of all hosts ZMap finds on TCP/443.

ZGrab is a fast, modular application-layer network scanner designed for completing large Internet-wide surveys. ZGrab is built to work with ZMap (ZMap identifies L4 responsive hosts, ZGrab performs in-depth, follow-up L7 handshakes). Unlike many other network scanners, ZGrab outputs detailed transcripts of network handshakes (e.g., all messages exchanged in a TLS handshake) for offline analysis.
