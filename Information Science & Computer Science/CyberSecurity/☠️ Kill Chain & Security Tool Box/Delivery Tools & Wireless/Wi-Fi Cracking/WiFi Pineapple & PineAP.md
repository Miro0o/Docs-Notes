## Intro
The WiFi Pineapple is more than hardware or software -- it's home to a helpful community of creative penetration testers and IT professionals. Welcome!

The WiFi Pineapple® NANO and TETRA are the 6th generation auditing platforms from Hak5 LLC. Thoughtfully developed for mobile and persistent deployments, they build on over 8 years of WiFi penetration testing expertise.

At the core of the WiFi Pineapple is PineAP, an advanced suite of wireless penetration testing tools for reconnaissance, man-in-the-middle, tracking, logging and reporting. Utilizing our unique hardware design, PineAP is the most effective rogue access point suite available.

Simplicity is key to any successful audit, which is why management of the WiFi Pineapple is conducted from an intuitive web interface. Built on modern standards for speed and responsiveness, the beautiful web interface puts the penetration tester in control from any device.

As a platform, the WiFi Pineapple is home to numerous community developed modules which add features and extend functionality. Modules install free directly from the web interface in seconds. Developing modules is made straightforward with an API friendly to coders at any experience level.
