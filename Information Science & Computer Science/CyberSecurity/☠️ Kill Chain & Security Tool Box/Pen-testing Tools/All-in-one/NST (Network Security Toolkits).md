## Intro
Welcome to the **Network Security Toolkit** (NST). This bootable ISO live USB Flash Drive (NST **Live**) is based on [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/). The toolkit was designed to provide easy access to best-of-breed Open Source Network Security Applications and should run on most x86_64 systems.

The main intent of developing this toolkit was to provide the security professional and network administrator with a comprehensive set of Open Source Network Security Tools. The majority of tools published in the article: [Top 125 Security Tools](http://www.insecure.org/tools.html) by [INSECURE.ORG](http://www.insecure.org/) are available in the toolkit. An advanced Web User Interface (WUI) is provided for system/network administration, navigation, automation, network monitoring, host geolocation, network analysis and configuration of many network and security applications found within the NSTdistribution. In the virtual world, NST can be used as a network security analysis validation and monitoring tool on enterprise virtual servers hosting virtual machines.
