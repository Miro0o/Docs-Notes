For a large project where you want to trace every function call—including those from system libraries—and visualize them as a graph, consider these comprehensive tools:

**Valgrind with Callgrind and KCachegrind**
- **Valgrind**: A powerful tool for memory debugging, which can also profile your application.
- **Callgrind**: A Valgrind tool that collects call graph information.
- **KCachegrind**: A graphical tool that visualizes call graphs generated by Callgrind.

**gprof with Graphviz**
- **gprof**: Can profile your application by tracking function calls and execution time.
- After generating the profile data, you can visualize it using Graphviz.

**SystemTap**

**DTrace (on macOS and Solaris)**

**Perf with Graph Visualization**

**Cflow**
