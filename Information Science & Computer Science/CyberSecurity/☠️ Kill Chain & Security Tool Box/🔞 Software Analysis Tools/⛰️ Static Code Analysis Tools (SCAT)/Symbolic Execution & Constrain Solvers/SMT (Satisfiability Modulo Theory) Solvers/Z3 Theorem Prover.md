Z3 API in Python
This tutorial demonstrates the main capabilities of Z3Py: the Z3 API inÂ [Python](http://www.python.org/). No Python background is needed to read this tutorial. However, it is useful to learn Python (a fun language!) at some point, and there are many excellent free resources for doing so ([Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/)).
The Z3 distribution also contains theÂ **C**,Â **.Net**Â andÂ **OCaml**Â APIs. The source code of Z3Py is available in the Z3 distribution, feel free to modify it to meet your needs. The source code also demonstrates how to use new features in Z3 4.0. Other cool front-ends for Z3 includeÂ [Scala^Z3](http://lara.epfl.ch/~psuter/ScalaZ3/)Â andÂ [SBV](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv).



## Intro
Z3 is a high performance theorem prover developed atÂ [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/). Z3 is used in many applications such as: software/hardware verification and testing, constraint solving, analysis of hybrid systems, security, biology (in silico analysis), and geometrical problems.



## Ref
[ðŸ¤” Understanding SMT solvers: An Introduction to Z3]: https://de-engineer.github.io/SMT-Solvers/
This post was an overview of SMT solvers with the practical example of a CTF challenge and we also touched a bit on their limitations. Iâ€™m not an expert on the topic, I tried to cover all the introductory knowledge that I could put in without increasing the complexity of the blog. There is indeed far more to learn about and you can do so by checking all the links in the resources section.
