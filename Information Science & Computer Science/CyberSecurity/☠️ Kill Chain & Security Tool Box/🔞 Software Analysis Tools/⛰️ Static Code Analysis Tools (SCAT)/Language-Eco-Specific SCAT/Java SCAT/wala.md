The T. J. Watson Libraries for Analysis (WALA) provide static analysis capabilities for Java bytecode and related languages and for JavaScript. The system is licensed under the [Eclipse Public License](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html), which has been approved by the [OSI](http://www.opensource.org/) (Open Source Initiative) as a fully certified open source license. The initial WALA infrastructure was independently developed as part of the DOMO research project at the [IBM T.J. Watson Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/). In 2006, [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/us/) donated the software to the community.
