- SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.
- This project is maintained by [Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com/), [Jason Haddix](https://twitter.com/Jhaddix), [Ignacio Portal](https://github.com/ItsIgnacioPortal) and [g0tmi1k](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/).

The list contains every wordlist, dictionary, and password database leak that I could find on the internet (and I spent a LOT of time looking). It also contains every word in the Wikipedia databases (pages-articles, retrieved 2010, all languages) as well as lots of books from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/). It also includes the passwords from some low-profile database breaches that were being sold in the underground years ago.

- The easiest way is do an Internet search for word lists and dictionaries. Also check out web sites for password cracking tools. Many times they have references to word lists. A few sources follow. Please add comments or additions to this thread: https://forum.aircrack-ng.org/index.php?topic=1373.0.
- Remember that valid passwords are 8 to 63 characters in length. The [Aircrack-ng Other Tips](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aircrack-ng#other_tips "aircrack-ng") page has a script to eliminate passwords which are invalid in terms of length.
