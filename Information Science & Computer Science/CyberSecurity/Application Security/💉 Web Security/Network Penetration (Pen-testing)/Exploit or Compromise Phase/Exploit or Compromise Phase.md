### Web Application Hacking Methodology
The methodology is divided into six stages: set target, spider and enumerate, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, cover tracks, and maintain access. These are explained in detail as follows:

1. **Set target**: Setting the right target during a penetration test is very important, as attackers will focus more on specific vulnerable systems to gain system-level access, as per the kill chain method.

2. **Spider and enumerate**: At this point, attackers have identified the list of web applications and are digging deeper into specific vulnerabilities. Multiple methods are engaged to spider all the web pages, identify technology, and find everything relevant to advance to the next stage.

3. **Vulnerability scanning**: All known vulnerabilities are collected during this phase, using well-known vulnerability databases containing public exploits or known common security misconfigurations.

4. **Exploitation**: This phase allows users to exploit known and unknown vulnerabilities, including the business logic of the application. For example, if an application is vulnerable to admin interface exposure, attackers can try to gain access to the interface by performing various types of attacks such as password guessing or brute-force attacks, or by exploiting specific admin interface vulnerabilities (for example, a JMX console attack on an admin interface without having to log in, deploy war files, and run a remote web shell).

5. **Covert racks**: At this stage, attackers erase all evidence of the hack. For example, if a system has been compromised by a file upload vulnerability and remote commands were executed on the server, attackers would attempt to clear the application server log, web server log, system logs, and other logs. Once tracks are covered, attackers ensure no logs are left that could reveal the origin of their exploitation.

6. **Maintain access**: Attackers could potentially plant a backdoor and also go on to perform privilege escalation or use the system as a zombie to perform more focused internal attacks, such as spreading ransomware on files that are shared in network drives, or even (in the case of bigger organizations) adding the victim system to a domain in order to take over the enterprise domain.
