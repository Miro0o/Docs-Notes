## Intro
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is **an open authentication protocol that works on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework**. Targeted toward consumers, OIDC allows individuals to use single sign-on (SSO) to access relying party sites using OpenID Providers (OPs), such as an email provider or social network, to authenticate their identities.
