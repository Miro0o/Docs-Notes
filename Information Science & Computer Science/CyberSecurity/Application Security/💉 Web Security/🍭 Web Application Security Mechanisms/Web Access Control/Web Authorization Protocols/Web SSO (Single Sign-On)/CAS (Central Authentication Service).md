Central authentication service, or CAS, is a single sign-on (SSO) protocol that allows websites to authenticate users.

Login credentials are only used once for multiple applications for [authentication](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/authentication/) without revealing the secure password. The application requiring authorization will redirect a user to a centralized trusted single server, the CAS server.

The CAS protocol can be used to authenticate untrusted web applications requiring a service ticket for access. CAS is a tool to authenticate a user, but this is not the same as authorizing one. Authorization is specific to the actual application.

The CAS approach can be simple to maintain and distribute to a large network of computers after the initial configuration. It can offer users convenience, consistency, and a high level of security.
