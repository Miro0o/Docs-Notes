- Phishing: Trick the victim into sending the attacker personal information
- Main vulnerability: The user can’t distinguish between a legitimate website and a website impersonating the legitimate website


### Phishing Attacks
#### Homograph Attacks
 **Creating malicious URLs that look similar (or the same) to legitimate URLs**
#### Browser-in-browser Attacks


### Phishing Defenses
Phishing: Don't Blame the Users!
- Most users aren’t security experts
- Attacks are uncommon: users normally don't suspect malicious action
- Detecting phishing is hard, even if you’re on the lookout for attacks
- Legitimate messages often look like phishing attacks!
