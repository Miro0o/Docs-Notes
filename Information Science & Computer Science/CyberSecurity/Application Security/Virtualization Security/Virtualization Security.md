Sharing some useful archives about vm and qemu escape exploit.

I want to collect what I can find. Also be welcome to provide me with issues.

In [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security), **virtual machine escape** is the process of breaking out of a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) and interacting with the host [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system).
