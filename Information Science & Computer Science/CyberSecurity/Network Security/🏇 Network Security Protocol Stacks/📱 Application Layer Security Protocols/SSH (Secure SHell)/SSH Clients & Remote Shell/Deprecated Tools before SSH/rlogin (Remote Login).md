The `rlogin` (remote login) program was a tool for remotely using a computer over a network. It could be used to get a command-line on a remote computer. It has since been superseded by [ssh](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/). Everyone who still has `rlogin` enabled is encouraged to immediately disable it for important security reasons.

The `rlogin` tool was introduced in BSD Unix in the 1980s. It was an important tool at the time, but it suffered from several shortcomings. Its security was poor, and its usability wasn't great.
