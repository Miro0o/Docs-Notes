## Intro
Mbed TLS is a C library that implements cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. Its small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems.

Mbed TLS includes a reference implementation of the [PSA Cryptography API](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls#psa-cryptography-api). This is currently a preview for evaluation purposes only.
