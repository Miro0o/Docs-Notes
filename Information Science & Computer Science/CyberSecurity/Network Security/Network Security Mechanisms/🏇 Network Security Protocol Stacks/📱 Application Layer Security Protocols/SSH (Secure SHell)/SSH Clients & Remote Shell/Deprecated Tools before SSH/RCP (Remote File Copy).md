The `rcp` (remote copy) program was a tool for copying files to/from remote computers. It has since been superceded by [ssh](https://www.ssh.com/ssh), particularly the [scp](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/scp)tool. Everyone who still has `rcp` enabled is encouraged to immediately disable it for important security reasons.

The `rcp` tool was introduced in BSD Unix in the 1980s. It was an important tool at the time, but it suffered from several shortcomings. Its security was poor, and its usability wasn't great.
