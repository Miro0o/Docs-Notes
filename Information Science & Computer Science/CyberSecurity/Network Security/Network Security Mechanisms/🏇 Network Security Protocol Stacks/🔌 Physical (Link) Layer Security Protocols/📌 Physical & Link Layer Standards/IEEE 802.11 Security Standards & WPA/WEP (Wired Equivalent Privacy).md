WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is **the oldest and most common Wi-Fi security protocol**. It was the privacy component established in the IEEE 802.11, a set of technical standards that aimed to provide a wireless local area network (WLAN) with a comparable level of security to a wired local area network (LAN).
