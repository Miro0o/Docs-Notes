## Intro
CCProxy is easy-to-use and powerful **proxy server**. CCProxy can support broadband, DSL, dial-up, optical fiber, satellite, ISDN and DDN connections, it helps you build your own [proxy server](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/proxy-server.htm) and [share Internet connection](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/share-internet-connection.htm) within the LAN efficiently and easily. 

CC Proxy Server can act as an HTTP, mail, FTP, SOCKS, news, telnet and [HTTPS proxy server](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/https-proxy-server.htm). It features powerful account management functions, including [Internet access control](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/accmgr.htm), [bandwidth control](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/bandwidth-control.htm), [Internet web filtering](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/internet-filter.htm), content filtering and time control. It also provides web caching, online access monitoring, access logging and bandwidth usage statistics functions.

As a [Window proxy server](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/window-proxy-server.htm), CCProxy is compatible with Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP and Vista. Many people use CCProxy for [Windows Internet sharing](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/windows-internet-sharing.htm) such as [Windows XP Internet sharing](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/internet-sharing-xp.htm), [Win 7 Internet sharing](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/win-7-internet-sharing.htm) and so on.

The first version of CC _Proxy Server_ was developed in August 2000.  
  
It was initially designed to modem sharing within a LAN. CC Proxy Server has now been expanded to support [sharing Internet connection](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/internet-connection-share.htm) for many other types, such as DSL sharing, cable modem sharing, wireless sharing, satellite sharing, parent proxy server connection sharing, [wifi internet sharing](https://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/wifi-internet-sharing.htm) and more. If there is a computer within a LAN that can access the Internet, all the other computers within the LAN can access the Internet via this proxy server software. This could make great savings for your business in terms of hardware and Internet connection fees.
