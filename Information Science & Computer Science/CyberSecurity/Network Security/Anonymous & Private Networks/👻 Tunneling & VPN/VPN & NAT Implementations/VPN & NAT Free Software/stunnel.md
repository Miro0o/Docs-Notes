**Stunnel is a proxy designed to add TLS encryption functionality to existing clients and servers without any changes in the programs' code.** Its [architecture](https://www.stunnel.org/features.html) is optimized for security, portability, and scalability (including load-balancing), making it suitable for large deployments.

Stunnel uses the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) library for cryptography, so it supports whatever cryptographic algorithms are compiled into the library. It can benefit from the [FIPS 140-2](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4282) validation of the OpenSSL FIPS Provider, as long as the building process meets the [OpenSSL FIPS 140-2 Security Policy](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp4282.pdf). Our latest Windows installer includes the OpenSSL FIPS Provider.
