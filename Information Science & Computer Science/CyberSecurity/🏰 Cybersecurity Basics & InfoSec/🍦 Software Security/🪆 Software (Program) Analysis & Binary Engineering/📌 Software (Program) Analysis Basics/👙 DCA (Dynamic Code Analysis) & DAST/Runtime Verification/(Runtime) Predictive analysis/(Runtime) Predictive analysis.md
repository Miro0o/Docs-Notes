**Runtime predictive analysis**Â (orÂ **predictive analysis**) is aÂ [runtime verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_verification "Runtime verification")Â technique inÂ [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science")Â for detecting property violations inÂ [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program")Â executions inferred from an observed execution. An important class of predictive analysis methods has been developed for detectingÂ [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_\(computer_science\) "Concurrency (computer science)")Â errors (such asÂ [data races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#Data_race "Race condition")) inÂ [concurrent programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_\(computing\)#Multithreading "Thread (computing)"), where a runtime monitor is used to predict errors which did not happen in the observed run, but can happen in an alternative execution of the same program. The predictive capability comes from the fact that the analysis is performed on an abstract model extracted online from the observed execution, which admits a class of executions beyond the observed one.
