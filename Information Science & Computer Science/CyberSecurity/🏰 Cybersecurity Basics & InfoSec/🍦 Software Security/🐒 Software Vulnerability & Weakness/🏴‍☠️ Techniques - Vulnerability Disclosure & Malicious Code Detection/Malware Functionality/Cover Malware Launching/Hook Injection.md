# Hook Injection

## Ref

### Use SetWindowsHookEX

```c
void Hook()
{
HINSTANCE hCurrentDll = GetModuleHandle(_T("WinHookFacade.dll"));
g_HookHandle = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_CBT,
FilterFunctionForHook,
hCurrentDll,
0);

if (g_HookHandle == NULL)
throw new std::exception("Unable to hook");
}
```

The key here would be the [SetWindowsHookEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644990(VS.85).aspx) Win32 API function. The first parameter is what **type of hook** you’d like to register for – See [this page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644959(VS.85).aspx) for available types. In this example, [WH_CBT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644959(VS.85).aspx#wh_cbthook) means events related to windows (creation,activation,destructions etc). The second parameter is the **name of the Hook/Filter function** that shall be called back by the OS – detailed below. The third parameter is a **handle to the DLL containing the hook function** for global hooks (if null, it indicates a thread-specific hook). The fourth parameter is 0 for global hooks (for thread/local hooks, it is the **Thread ID** you want to hook into).

```c
#include <Windows.h>
 
// variable to store the HANDLE to the hook. Don't declare it anywhere else then globally
// or you will get problems since every function uses this variable.
HHOOK _hook;
 
// This struct contains the data received by the hook callback. As you see in the callback function
// it contains the thing you will need: vkCode = virtual key code.
KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT kbdStruct;
 
// This is the callback function. Consider it the event that is raised when, in this case, 
// a key is pressed.
LRESULT __stdcall HookCallback(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
	if (nCode >= 0)
	{
		// the action is valid: HC_ACTION.
		if (wParam == WM_KEYDOWN)
		{
			// lParam is the pointer to the struct containing the data needed, so cast and assign it to kdbStruct.
			kbdStruct = *((KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT*)lParam);
			// a key (non-system) is pressed.
			if (kbdStruct.vkCode == VK_F1)
			{
				// F1 is pressed!
				MessageBox(NULL, "F1 is pressed!", "key pressed", MB_ICONINFORMATION);
			}
		}
	}
 
	// call the next hook in the hook chain. This is nessecary or your hook chain will break and the hook stops
	return CallNextHookEx(_hook, nCode, wParam, lParam);
}
 
void SetHook()
{
	// Set the hook and set it to use the callback function above
	// WH_KEYBOARD_LL means it will set a low level keyboard hook. More information about it at MSDN.
	// The last 2 parameters are NULL, 0 because the callback function is in the same thread and window as the
	// function that sets and releases the hook. If you create a hack you will not need the callback function 
	// in another place then your own code file anyway. Read more about it at MSDN.
	if (!(_hook = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_KEYBOARD_LL, HookCallback, NULL, 0)))
	{
		MessageBox(NULL, "Failed to install hook!", "Error", MB_ICONERROR);
	}
}
 
void ReleaseHook()
{
	UnhookWindowsHookEx(_hook);
}
 
void main()
{
	// Set the hook
	SetHook();
 
	// Don't mind this, it is a meaningless loop to keep a console application running.
	// I used this to test the keyboard hook functionality. If you want to test it, keep it in ;)
	MSG msg;
	while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0))
	{
 
	}
}
