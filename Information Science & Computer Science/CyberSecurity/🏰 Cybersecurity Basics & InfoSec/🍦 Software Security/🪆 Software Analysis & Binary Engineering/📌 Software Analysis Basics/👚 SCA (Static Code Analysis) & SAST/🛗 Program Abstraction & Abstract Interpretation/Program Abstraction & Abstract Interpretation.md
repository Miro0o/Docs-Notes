The theory of abstract interpretation provides a solid mathematical foundation for what it means for an analysis to be sound, by relating the analysis specification to the formal semantics of the programming language. Another use of abstract interpretation is for understanding whether an analysis design, or a part of an analysis design, is as precise as possible relative to a choice of analysis lattice and where imprecision may arise. The fundamental ideas of abstract interpretation were introduced by Cousot and Cousot in the 1970s [CC76, CC77, CC79b].
