> IT security standards

**IT security standards** or **cyber security standards** are techniques generally outlined in published materials that attempt to protect the cyber environment of a user or organization. This environment includes users themselves, networks, devices, all software, processes, information in storage or transit, applications, services, and systems that can be connected directly or indirectly to networks. 

The principal objective is to reduce the risks, including preventing or mitigating [cyber-attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-attack "Cyber-attack"). These published materials consist of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies



## 🌐 Global Institutions & Organizations
### ISO
The [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization") (ISO) is an international standards organization organized as a consortium of national standards institutions from 167 countries, coordinated through a secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO is the world's largest developer of international standards. The [International Electrotechnical Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission "International Electrotechnical Commission") (IEC) is an international standards organization that deals with electrotechnology and cooperates closely with ISO. ISO/IEC 15443: "Information technology – Security techniques – A framework for IT security assurance", [ISO/IEC 27002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27002 "ISO/IEC 27002"): "Information technology – Security techniques – Code of practice for information security management", [ISO/IEC 20000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_20000 "ISO/IEC 20000"): "Information technology – Service management", and [ISO/IEC 27001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001 "ISO/IEC 27001"): "Information technology – Security techniques – Information security management systems – Requirements" are of particular interest to information security professionals.


### ISOS (IETF|IAB|RFCs|etc..)
[The Internet Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Society "The Internet Society") is a professional membership society with more than 100 organizations and over 20,000 individual members in over 180 countries. It provides leadership in addressing issues that confront the future of the internet, and it is the organizational home for the groups responsible for internet infrastructure standards, including the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") (IETF) and the [Internet Architecture Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Architecture_Board "Internet Architecture Board") (IAB). The ISOC hosts the Requests for Comments (RFCs) which includes the Official Internet Protocol Standards and the RFC-2196 [Site Security Handbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Security_Handbook "Site Security Handbook").


### ISF
The [Information Security Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Security_Forum "Information Security Forum") (ISF) is a global nonprofit organization of several hundred leading organizations in financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, consumer goods, government, and other areas. It undertakes research into information security practices and offers advice in its biannual [Standard of Good Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_Good_Practice "Standard of Good Practice") and more detailed advisories for members.


### IISP
The [Institute of Information Security Professionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Information_Security_Professionals "Institute of Information Security Professionals") (IISP) is an independent, non-profit body governed by its members, with the principal objective of advancing the professionalism of information security practitioners and thereby the professionalism of the industry as a whole. The institute developed the IISP Skills Framework. This framework describes the range of competencies expected of information security and information assurance professionals in the effective performance of their roles. It was developed through collaboration between both private and public sector organizations, world-renowned academics, and security leaders.[[382]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#cite_note-382)



## Regional Institutes & Organizations

### 🇺🇸 NIST
The US [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology "National Institute of Standards and Technology") (NIST) is a non-regulatory federal agency within the [U.S. Department of Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Commerce "U.S. Department of Commerce"). The NIST Computer Security Division develops standards, metrics, tests, and validation programs as well as publishes standards and guidelines to increase secure IT planning, implementation, management, and operation. NIST is also the custodian of the U.S. [Federal Information Processing Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard "Federal Information Processing Standard") publications (FIPS).


### 🇩🇪 BSI
The German [Federal Office for Information Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Office_for_Information_Security "Federal Office for Information Security") (in German _Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)_) BSI-Standards 100–1 to 100-4 are a set of recommendations including "methods, processes, procedures, approaches and measures relating to information security".[[383]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#cite_note-383) The BSI-Standard 100-2 _IT-Grundschutz Methodology_ describes how information security management can be implemented and operated. The standard includes a very specific guide, the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs (also known as IT-Grundschutz Catalogs). Before 2005, the catalogs were formerly known as "[IT Baseline Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_baseline_protection "IT baseline protection") Manual". The Catalogs are a collection of documents useful for detecting and combating security-relevant weak points in the IT environment (IT cluster). The collection encompasses as of September 2013 over 4,400 pages with the introduction and catalogs. The IT-Grundschutz approach is aligned with to the ISO/IEC 2700x family.


### 🇪🇺 ISG ISI
The [European Telecommunications Standards Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Telecommunications_Standards_Institute "European Telecommunications Standards Institute") standardized a catalog of [information security indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security_indicators "Information security indicators"), headed by the Industrial Specification Group (ISG) ISI.
