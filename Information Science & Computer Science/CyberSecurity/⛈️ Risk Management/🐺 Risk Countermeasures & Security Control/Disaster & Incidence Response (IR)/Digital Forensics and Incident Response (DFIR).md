Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) is a practice used by incident response teams (also known as computer security incident response teams or CSIRT) to detect, investigate, and respond to cyber threats facing an organization.Â 

A core part of DFIR isÂ [digital forensics](https://www.bluevoyant.com/knowledge-center/understanding-digital-forensics-process-techniques-and-tools)Â â€” collecting data from IT systems, including operating systems, file systems, and hardware, analyzing it, and reconstructing it for use as evidence in the incident response process. Increasingly, DFIR is being used beyond CSIRT teams, and forensic investigation practices are adopted for additional activities like remote investigation of endpoints and proactive threat hunting.
