## Intro
### SRC (Security Response Center)



### CERT, CSIRT, CIRT
> 🔗 https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/CERT-vs-CSIRT-vs-SOC-Whats-the-difference

- CSIRT stands for computer security incident response team.
- [CERT](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/CERT-Computer-Emergency-Readiness-Team) stands for computer emergency response (or readiness) team. 
- And CIRT can stand for either computer incident response team or, less frequently, cybersecurity incident response team. 

CSIRT, CERT and CIRT are often used interchangeably in the field. In fact, CSIRT and CIRT are almost always near-equivalent; essentially they are synonymous. An organization might prefer one or the other based on the organization's language or style, or subtle differences in organizational scope.
