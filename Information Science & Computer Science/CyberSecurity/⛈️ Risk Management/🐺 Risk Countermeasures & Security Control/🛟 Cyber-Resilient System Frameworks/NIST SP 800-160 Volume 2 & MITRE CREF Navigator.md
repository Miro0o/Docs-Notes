### MITRE CREF Navigator
Comprehensive technical frameworks are usually voluminous including several definitions, concepts, relationships, tables, and references with linkages to other key frameworks or publications. NIST SP 800-160 Volume 2 (Rev 1): ‚ÄúDeveloping Cyber-Resilient Systems‚Äù is the leading framework defining and impacting the cyber resiliency space for US federal information systems. It is a comprehensive framework that is generally applicable and can be adopted by any organization seeking comprehensive and well-defined cyber resilience guidance. The publication is 310 pages and rather daunting to novices seeking cyber resiliency guidance and relationships to other key frameworks like NIST SP 800-53 (Rev 5) or the ATT&CK¬Æ Framework.¬†

The CREF Navigator‚Ñ¢ was developed as a web based relational tool distilling the complex concepts and relationships from NIST SP 800-160 Volume 2 (Rev 1) into useful cyber resiliency terms, tables, and relationship visualizations enabling architectural and engineering analysis. The tool contains a hover-over, clickable dictionary of cyber resiliency terms; customizable visualization of complex relationships to other frameworks; the ability to balance and prioritize cyber resiliency choices based on nodal analysis; and export and import capabilities from ATT&CK¬Æ Navigator for presentation and analysis. The tool also provides an excellent crash course reference and training tool for those uninitiated to cyber resiliency concepts that is available to the masses via the internet for free.
