PURPLE TEAM TEST
A collaborative cyber security test exercise mimicking the most prevalent attacker techniques where the cyber attackers and defenders work together.

RED TEAM TEST
A realistic, coordinated, targeted & threat intelligence led attack, simulating the worst-case scenarios for a client.
- Validate your security investments
- Evaluate the sum of all the parts
- Measure depth & mean time to detection
- Determine response against targeted intrusion attempts
- Determine ‚Äúleast resistance‚Äù public attack surface
- Allow for post-mortem analysis & improvement
- Identify areas for continuous testing and ‚Äúpurple teaming‚Äù
- Threat intelligence led e.g. DORA, TIBER, CBEST
