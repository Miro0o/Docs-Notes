A bug is when a system isn't behaving as it's designed to behave.

A vulnerability is a way of abusing the system (most commonly in a security-related way) - whether that's due to a design fault or an implementation fault. In other words, something can have a vulnerability due to a defective design, even if the implementation of that design is perfect.
