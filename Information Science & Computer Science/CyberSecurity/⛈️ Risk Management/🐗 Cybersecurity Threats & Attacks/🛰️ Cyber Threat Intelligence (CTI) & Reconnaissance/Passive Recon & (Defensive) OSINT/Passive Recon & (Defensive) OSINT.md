Pastebin is a website where you can store any text online for easy sharing. The website is mainly used by programmers to store pieces of sources code or configuration information, but anyone is more than welcome to paste any type of text. The idea behind the site is to make it more convenient for people to share large amounts of text online.

OSINT Framework
OSINT framework focused on gathering information from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for \$\$\$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost.  

I originally created this framework with an information security point of view. Since then, the response from other fields and disciplines has been incredible. I would love to be able to include any other OSINT resources, especially from fields outside of infosec. Please let me know about anything that might be missing!

## Intro
**Passive reconnaissance through OSINT** occurs during the first step of the kill chain when conducting a penetration test, or an attack against a network or server target.

Generally, passive reconnaissance is concerned with analyzing information that is openly available, usually from the target itself or public sources online. On accessing this information, the tester or attacker does not interact with the target in an unusual manner—requests and activities will not be logged, or will not be traced directly to the tester. Therefore, passive reconnaissance is conducted first to minimize the direct contact that may signal an impending attack or to identify the attacker.

##### Defensive OSINT
Defensive OSINT is typically used to see what is already on internet including breached information and see whether that information is valuable during the penetration testing activity. If the goal of penetration testing is to demonstrate the real-world scenario where this data can be handy, the first step is to identify a similar target that has already been breached. The majority of organizations fix only the affected platform or the host, and often they forget about other similar environments. The defensive OSINT is largely divided into three places of search.

- ↗ [DarkWeb](../../../../Network%20Security/Anonymous%20&%20Private%20Networks/DarkWeb.md)
- Security breach
	- A security breach is any incident that results in unauthorized access of data, applications, services, networks, and/or devices by bypassing their underlying security mechanisms. These websites have an archive of breached data.
	- http://zone-h.com
	- https://databases.today
	- https://haveibeenpwned.com
- ↗ [Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) & Reconnaissance](../Cyber%20Threat%20Intelligence%20(CTI)%20&%20Reconnaissance.md)
	- Threat intelligence is controlled, calculated, and refined information about potential or current attacks that threaten an organization. The primary purpose of this kind of intelligence is to ensure organizations are aware of the current risks, such as **Advanced Persistent Threats** (**APTs**), **zero-day exploits**, and other severe external threats. 
	- Penetration testers or attackers will always subscribe to these kinds of open source threat intelligence frameworks, such as STIX and TAXII, or utilize, GOSINT framework for **indicators of compromise** (**IOCs**)
- etc.

### User Profiling
Lists of commonly used passwords are available for download, and are stored locally on Kali in the `/usr/share/wordlists` directory. However this is only the relflection of mass choices. For particular user, there's a better way. 
#### Gathering usernames & email address
##### 👉 theHarvester
The theHarvester tool is a Python script that searches through popular search engines and other sites for email addresses, hosts, and sub-domains.

Using theHarvester is relatively simple, as there are only a few command switches to set. The options available are as follows:
- -d: This identifies the domain to be searched; usually the domain or target's website.  
- -b: This identifies the source for extracting the data; it must be one of the following: Bing, BingAPI, Google, Google-Profiles, Jigsaw, LinkedIn, People123, PGP, or All.
- -l: This limiting option instructs theHarvester to only harvest data from a specified number of returned search results.  
- -f: This option is used to save the final results to an HTML and an XML file. If this option is omitted, the results will be displayed on the screen, and not saved.
#### Creating custom wordlists for cracking passwords
##### 👉 CUPP
↗ [CUPP (Common User Password Profiler)](../../../../../☠️%20Kill%20Chain%20&%20Security%20Tool%20Box/Credentials%20&%20Password%20Related%20Tools/📌%20Wordlist%20&%20User%20Password%20Profile/CUPP%20(Common%20User%20Password%20Profiler).md)
##### twofi
🔗 https://github.com/digininja/twofi/tree/master

While we can profile a user utilizing social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and so on, we can also use twofi, which stands for **Twitter words of interest**. This tool is written in Ruby script and utilizes the Twitter API to generate a custom list of words that can be utilized for offline password cracking.
##### 👉 CeWL
CeWL is a Ruby app that spiders a given URL to a specified depth, optionally following external links, and returns a list of words that can then be used for password crackers such as **John the Ripper**.
