## Intro
### Online Attacks /Offline Attacks
Offline attack: The attacker performs all the computation themselves
- Example: Mallory steals the password file, and then computes hashes herself to check for matches.
- The attacker can try a huge number of passwords (e.g., use many GPUs in parallel)
- Defenses: Salt passwords, use slow hashes
- If an attacker can do an offline attack, you need a really strong password (e.g. 7 or more random words)

Online attack: The attacker interacts with the service
- Example: Mallory tries to log in to a website by trying every different password. Mallory is forcing the server to compute the hashes.
- The attacker can usually only try a few times per second, with no parallelism
- Defenses: Add a timeout or rate limit the number of tries to prevent the attacker from trying too many times
