## Intro
> 🔗 https://attack.mitre.org/resources/ | get started

MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. ATT&CK focuses on how adversaries interact with systems during an operation, reflecting the various phases of an adversary’s attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

With the creation of ATT&CK, MITRE is fulfilling its mission to solve problems for a safer world — by bringing communities together to develop more effective cybersecurity. ATT&CK is open and available to any person or organization for use at no charge.

Read the [ATT&CK 101 Blog post](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/att-ck-101-17074d3bc62) for more information on the basics of ATT&CK and check the short video below.


### Key Concepts
ATT&CK is a model that attempts to systematically categorize adversary behavior. The main components of the model are:
- **[Tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/)**, represents “why” or the reason an adversary is performing an action
- **[Techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/)**, represents “how” adversaries achieve tactical goals by performing an action
- **Sub-techniques**, a more specific or lower-level description of adversarial behavior
- **Procedures**, specific implementation or in-the-wild use the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques

ATT&CK is organized in a series of technology domains, the ecosystem an adversary operates within. Currently, there are three **technology** domains:
- **[Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)**, representing traditional enterprise networks and cloud technologies
- **[Mobile](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/mobile/)** for mobile communication devices
- **[ICS](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/ics/)** for industrial control systems

Within each domain are **platforms**, which may be an operating system or application (e.g. Microsoft Windows). Techniques and sub-techniques can apply to multiple platforms.

For more information on the principles behind ATT&CK, its creation, and its ongoing maintenance, read the [ATT&CK Philosophy Paper](https://attack.mitre.org/docs/ATTACK_Design_and_Philosophy_March_2020.pdf). For additional information focused on ATT&CK for ICS, including the unique elements and commonalities with ATT&CK, read the [ATT&CK for ICS Extension](https://attack.mitre.org/docs/ATTACK_for_ICS_Philosophy_March_2020.pdf).
