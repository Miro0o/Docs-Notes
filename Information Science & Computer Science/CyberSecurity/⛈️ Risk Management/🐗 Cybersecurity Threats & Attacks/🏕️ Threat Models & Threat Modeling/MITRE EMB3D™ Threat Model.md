EMB3D is a threat model for embedded devices found in industries such as critical infrastructure, Internet of Things, automotive, healthcare, manufacturing, and many more. The threat model is intended to be a resource to help vendors, asset owners/operators, test organizations, and security researchers to improve the overall security of embedded devices' hardware and software. This threat model aims to serve as a central repository of information, defining known threats to embedded devices and their unique device features/properties that enable specific threat actions. By mapping the threats to the associated device features/properties, the user can easily enumerate threat exposure based on the known device features.
