## Intro
> 🔗 https://capec.mitre.org/about/new_to_capec.html

First, we should describe what an attack pattern is. A good summary can be found [here](https://capec.mitre.org/about/index.html). CAPEC entries are related to ↗ [CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)](../../🦟%20Vulnerabilities/CWE%20(Common%20Weakness%20Enumeration).md) and ↗ [CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)](../../../🏰%20Cybersecurity%20Basics%20&%20InfoSec/🍦%20Software%20Security/🐒%20Software%20Vulnerability%20&%20Weakness/Vulnerability%20Mangement%20Sections/📌%20Vulnerability%20Government（漏洞管控）/Vulnerability%20Databases%20&%20Sources/CVE%20(Common%20Vulnerabilities%20and%20Exposures).md). 

The differences between ↗ [ATT&CK（Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge）](ATT&CK（Adversarial%20Tactics,%20Techniques,%20and%20Common%20Knowledge）.md) another related corpus, and CAPEC are discussed [here](https://capec.mitre.org/about/attack_comparison.html).

Attack patterns are based on software design patterns (see _[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)_> by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides), which are common paradigms for solving common software design issues. In this context, _attack patterns are design patterns for attackers_.

As seen in the above figure, a CAPEC attack pattern is typically a method of leveraging a CWE to execute an attack. For this reason, most CAPEC entries contain an “execution flow” — step-by-step instructions for an adversary to explore for potential targets, experiment with their assets and defensive mechanisms, if any, and then to carry out the exploit.
