## Intro
### Electronics Industry
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_industry

The electronics industry is the economic sector that produces electronic devices. It emerged in the 20th century and is today one of the largest global industries. Contemporary society uses a vast array of electronic devices that are built in factories operated by the industry, which are almost always partially automated.

Electronic products are primarily assembled from **metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS)** transistors and **integrated circuits**, the latter principally by photolithography and often on **printed circuit boards**.

Circuit boards are assembled largely using surface-mount technology, which typically involves the automated placement of electronic parts on circuit boards using pick-and-place machines. Surface-mount technology and pick-and-place machines make it possible to assemble large numbers of circuit boards at high speed.
The industry's size, the use of toxic materials, and the difficulty of recycling have led to a series of problems with electronic waste. International regulation and environmental legislation have been developed to address the issues.

The electronics industry consists of various sectors. The central driving force behind the entire electronics industry is the semiconductor industry sector, which has annual sales of over $481 billion as of 2018

### Technology Life Circles
> 📖 New perspectives in computer concepts, 21 ed, Module 8: The ICT Industry

**What is the digital product life cycle?** 
From the perspective of a business that creates and sells a technology product, the product life cycle (PLC) maps the expected profitability of a product from its inception to its demise. A graph of the PLC begins with negative profitability during research and development, rises to a peak as sales increase, and then declines as the product is gradually replaced.

**What is Rogers’ bell curve?** 
A team of sociologists including Everett M. Rogers developed a model to explain how products diffuse through the marketplace and the way in which such diffusion affects commodity prices. This model, called Rogers’ bell curve, is frequently used to describe patterns in the way consumers adopt technology products. Rogers’ bell curve shows that a small group of innovators initially experiment with a product, which then is picked up by early adopters before spreading to a majority of the population. The price of products begins to decline in the Late Majority phase. Later, laggards adopt the product, and eventually the product is no longer of interest to consumers.

**What is the Gartner Hype Cycle?** 
Analysts at Gartner, Inc., have been tracking technology trends for decades. They devised a proprietary model called the Gartner Hype Cycle that represents the position of a product during its life cycle of publicity or “hype.” The curve of the Gartner Hype Cycle is quite different from that of Rogers’ bell curve. Publicity about new products reaches a peak long before its mainstream adoption. This peak of inflated expectation gives way to disillusionment before consumers form a realistic understanding of a product’s potential and put it to use productively.
