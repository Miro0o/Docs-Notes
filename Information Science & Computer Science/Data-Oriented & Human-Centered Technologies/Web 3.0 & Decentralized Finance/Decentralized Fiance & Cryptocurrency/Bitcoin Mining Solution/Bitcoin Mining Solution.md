bitaxe is a fully open source Bitcoin ASIC miner aimed at decentralizing mining. bitaxeGamma is the 5th major revision of the bitaxe that now includes the BM1370 ASIC from the Antminer S21 Pro

This is **NOT** a pool despite its name; it is a service to allow miners to mine solo blocks as you cannot mine directly to a Bitcoin Core node.



## Intro



## Mining Pool
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_pool#Transaction_fees

In the context of cryptocurrency mining, a mining pool is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network, to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. A "share" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work. Mining in pools began when the difficulty for mining increased to the point where it could take centuries for slower miners to generate a block. The solution to this problem was for miners to pool their resources so they could generate blocks more quickly and therefore receive a portion of the block reward on a consistent basis, rather than randomly once every few years.
