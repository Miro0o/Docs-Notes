## Intro
Game Porting Toolkit is Apple's new translation layer released on 6th June, 2023. Game Porting Toolkit (**GPTK**) combines Wine with Apple's own D3DMetal which supports DirectX 11 and 12. This is a less user-friendly method of installing Windows games on Apple Silicon Macs compared to [CrossOver](https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/CrossOver "CrossOver") or [Parallels](https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/Parallels "Parallels"), however it unlocks the ability to play many DirectX 12 games. A lot more games work using GPTK, however, games that use anti-cheat or aggressive DRMs generally don't work, along with games that require AVX/AVX 2,[[2]](https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/Game_Porting_Toolkit#cite_note-2) e.g. The Last of Us Part I.
