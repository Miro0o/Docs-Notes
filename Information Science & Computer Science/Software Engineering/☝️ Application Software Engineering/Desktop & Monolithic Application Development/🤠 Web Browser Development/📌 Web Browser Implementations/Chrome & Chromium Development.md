The Chromium projects include Chromium and ChromiumOS, the open-source projects behind the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) browser and Google ChromeOS, respectively. This site houses the documentation and code related to the Chromium projects and is intended for developers interested in learning about and contributing to the open-source projects.
- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web. This site contains design documents, architecture overviews, testing information, and more to help you learn to build and work with the Chromium source code.

<small>Diagram of Chrome's multi-process architecture. Multiple layers are shown under Renderer Process to represent Chrome running multiple Renderer Processes for each tab.</small>

Chromium uses multiple processes to protect the overall application from bugs and glitches in the rendering engine or other components. It also restricts access from each rendering engine process to other processes and to the rest of the system. In some ways, this brings to web browsing the benefits that memory protection and access control brought to operating systems.

We refer to the main process that runs the UI and manages renderer and other processes as the "**browser process**" or "browser." Likewise, the processes that handle web content are called "**renderer processes**" or "renderers." The renderers use the [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink) open-source layout engine for interpreting and laying out HTML.
