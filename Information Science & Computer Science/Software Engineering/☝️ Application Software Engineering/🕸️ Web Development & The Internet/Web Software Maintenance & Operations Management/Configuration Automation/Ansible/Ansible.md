### Learning Ansible
You can learn Ansible by [using it at home](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/ansible-documentation-kids-laptops) or [at work](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/quickstart-guide-ansible). If you're new to `YAML`, üêê [take time to learn it](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/yaml-tips?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7nAAG) and then write your first playbook. If you prefer to start small, you can install Ansible on your personal computer and use it to manage itself or just a few computers on your home network. Most importantly, [try different modules](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/must-know-ansible-modules) so you can get comfortable using and configuring new ones. They're your gateway to making your nodes conform to your infrastructure designs, and Ansible is the engine that makes it possible.

## Intro
> üëâ  [What is Ansibe?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-ansible)

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a software tool (writen in python) that provides simple but powerful automation for cross-platform computer support. It is primarily intended for IT professionals, who use it for **application deployment, updates on workstations and servers, cloud provisioning, configuration management, intra-service orchestration**, and nearly anything a systems administrator does on a weekly or daily basis. Ansible doesn't depend on agent software and has no additional security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy.
