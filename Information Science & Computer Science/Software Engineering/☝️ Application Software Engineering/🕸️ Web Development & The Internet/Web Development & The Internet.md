## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#

**Web development** is the work involved in developing a [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_site "Web site") for the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") ([World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web")) or an [intranet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet "Intranet") (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single [static page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_Web_page "Static Web page") of [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text "Plain text") to complex [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application "Web application"), [electronic businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_business "Electronic business"), and [social network services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service "Social network service"). A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include [Web engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_engineering "Web engineering"), [Web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design "Web design"), [Web content development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_development "Web content development"), client liaison, [client-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_scripting "Client-side scripting")/[server-side scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting "Server-side scripting"), [Web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server") and [network security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_security "Network security") configuration, and [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce "E-commerce") development.

Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing [markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language") and [coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"). Web development may use [content management systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system "Content management system") (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people ([Web developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer "Web developer")) and follow standard methods like [Agile methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development "Agile software development") while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a [graphic designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_designer "Graphic designer") or [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems "Information systems") technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: [front-end developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_Web_development "Front-end Web development"), back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#Evolution_of_the_World_Wide_Web_and_web_development

**Origin/ Web 1.0** (Web you can see)
- [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee "Tim Berners-Lee") created the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web") in 1989 at CERN.
- The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") was developed in 1993.
- Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information. Core protocols of web 1.0 were [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP"), HTML and [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier "Uniform Resource Identifier").

**Web 2.0** (Web you can talk)
- [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 "Web 2.0"), a term popularised by [Dale Dougherty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Dougherty "Dale Dougherty"), then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.
- Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a user-focused, read-write online network.
- In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities such as creating music, files, images, and movies. The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the "backbone of the internet," using standardized [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize information flow from independent platforms and [online databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_database "Online database").

**Web 3.0** (Web you can interact & own)
- ↗ [Web 3.0 & Decentralized Finance](../../../Data-Oriented%20&%20Human-Centered%20Technologies/Web%203.0%20&%20Decentralized%20Finance/Web%203.0%20&%20Decentralized%20Finance.md)
	- ↗ [Decentralized Fiance & Cryptocurrency](../../../Data-Oriented%20&%20Human-Centered%20Technologies/Web%203.0%20&%20Decentralized%20Finance/Decentralized%20Fiance%20&%20Cryptocurrency/Decentralized%20Fiance%20&%20Cryptocurrency.md)
	- ↗ [Web 3.0](../../../Data-Oriented%20&%20Human-Centered%20Technologies/Web%203.0%20&%20Decentralized%20Finance/Web%203.0/Web%203.0.md)

- Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign of the web. Key features include the integration of [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata"), precise information delivery, and improved [user experiences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience "User experience") based on preferences, history, and interests.
- Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than traditional search engines. Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles.
- This version is sometimes also known as [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web "Semantic Web").


### 📜 Technical Evolution of Web Development
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#Evolution_of_web_development_technologies

The journey of web development technologies began with simple [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") pages in the early days of the internet. Over time, advancements led to the incorporation of [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS "CSS") for styling and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") for interactivity. This evolution transformed static websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.
- Static HTML Pages (1990s)
- Introduction of [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS "CSS") (late 1990s)

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting

With the advent of [single-page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application "Single-page application"), an updated approach to server-side scripting was introduced, known as server-side rendering. With server-side rendering, static HTML can be sent from the server to the client, and client-side JavaScript then makes the web page [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page "Dynamic web page") by attaching event handlers to the HTML elements in a process called [hydration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydration_\(web_development\) "Hydration (web development)"). Examples of frameworks that support server-side rendering are [Next.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next.js "Next.js"), [Nuxt.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxt.js "Nuxt.js"), [Angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_\(web_framework\) "Angular (web framework)").

An alternative to server-side rendering is [static site generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator "Static site generator"). With server-side rendering, the page is generally assembled on the server once per each request. By contrast, with static site generation, the application generates all the static HTML pages at build time. These pre-built pages are then sent to the client at each request, without having to build them again. This leads to faster rendering times, since a new page doesn't have to be generated on every request; the server simply hands over a file it already generated in the past. The downside is that when some data on the page changes, it needs to be rebuilt. Examples of static site generation tools are [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_\(software\) "Jekyll (software)") and [Gatsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatsby_\(software\) "Gatsby (software)"). Sites generated by static site generation tools are often hosted on [Netlify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlify "Netlify"), [Vercel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercel "Vercel") or [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub "GitHub") pages.
