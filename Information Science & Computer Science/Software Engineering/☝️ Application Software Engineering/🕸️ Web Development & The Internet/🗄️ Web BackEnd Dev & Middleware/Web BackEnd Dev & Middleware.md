### Server-Side languages
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#Server-side_languages

[Programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") aimed at server execution, as opposed to client browser execution, are known as [server-side languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting "Server-side scripting"). These programming languages are used in web development to perform operations including [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing"), database interaction, and the creation of [dynamic content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page "Dynamic web page") that is delivered to the client's browser. A key element of server-side programming is [server-side scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting "Server-side scripting"), which allows the server to react to client requests in real time.

Some popular server-side languages are:
1. **PHP:** [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP") is a widely used, [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") server-side scripting language. It is embedded in HTML code and is particularly well-suited for web development.
2. **Python:** [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_\(programming_language\) "Python (programming language)") is a versatile, high-level programming language used for a variety of purposes, including server-side web development. Frameworks like [Django](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_\(web_framework\) "Django (web framework)") and [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_\(web_framework\) "Flask (web framework)") make it easy to build web applications in Python.
3. **Ruby:** [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_\(programming_language\) "Ruby (programming language)") is an object-oriented programming language, and it is commonly used for web development. [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails "Ruby on Rails") is a popular web framework that simplifies the process of building web applications.
4. **Java:** [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_\(programming_language\) "Java (programming language)") is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Java-based frameworks like [Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework "Spring Framework") are commonly used for building enterprise-level web applications.
5. **Node.js (JavaScript):** While JavaScript is traditionally a client-side language, [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js "Node.js") enables developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It is known for its event-driven, non-blocking [I/O model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_model "I/O model"), making it suitable for building scalable and high-performance applications.
6. **C# (C Sharp):** [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_\(programming_language\) "C Sharp (programming language)") is a programming language developed by Microsoft and is commonly used in conjunction with the [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework ".NET Framework") framework for building web applications on the Microsoft stack.
7. **ASP.NET:** [ASP.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET "ASP.NET") is a web framework developed by Microsoft, and it supports languages like C# and [VB.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_\(.NET\) "Visual Basic (.NET)"). It simplifies the process of building dynamic web applications.
8. **Go (Golang):** [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_\(programming_language\) "Go (programming language)") is a statically typed language developed by Google. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency and is increasingly being used for building scalable and high-performance web applications.
9. **Perl:** [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl "Perl") is a versatile scripting language often used for web development. It is known for its powerful [text-processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_processing "Text processing") capabilities.
10. **Swift:** Developed by Apple, [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_\(programming_language\) "Swift (programming language)") is used for server-side development in addition to iOS and macOS app development.
11. **Lua:** [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_\(programming_language\) "Lua (programming language)") is used for some embedded web servers, e.g. the configuration pages on a [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_\(computing\) "Router (computing)"), including [OpenWRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWRT "OpenWRT").
