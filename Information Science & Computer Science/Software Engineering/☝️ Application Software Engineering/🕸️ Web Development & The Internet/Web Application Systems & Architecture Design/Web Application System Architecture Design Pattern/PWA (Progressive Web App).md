AÂ **progressive web application**Â (**PWA**), orÂ **progressive web app**, is a type ofÂ [web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_app "Web app")Â that can be installed on a device as a standaloneÂ [application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software").Â PWAs are installed using the offline cache of the device'sÂ [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser").

PWAs were introduced from 2016 as an alternative toÂ [native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_\(computing\) "Native (computing)")Â (device-specific) applications, with the advantage that they do not require separate bundling or distribution for different platforms. They can be used on a range of different systems, includingÂ [desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer "Desktop computer")Â andÂ [mobile devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device "Mobile device"). Publishing the app to digital distribution systems, such as theÂ [Apple App Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_\(iOS/iPadOS\) "App Store (iOS/iPadOS)"),Â [Google Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play "Google Play"), or theÂ [Microsoft Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Store "Microsoft Store")Â on Windows, is optional.

Because a PWA is delivered in the form of aÂ [webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpage "Webpage")Â orÂ [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website "Website")Â built using common web technologies includingÂ [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"),Â [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets"),Â [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"), andÂ [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly "WebAssembly"), Â it can work on any platform with a PWA-compatible browser. As of 2025, PWA features are supported to varying degrees byÂ [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome "Google Chrome"),Â [Apple Safari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_\(web_browser\) "Safari (web browser)"),Â [Brave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_\(web_browser\) "Brave (web browser)"),Â [Firefox for Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_for_Android "Firefox for Android"),Â [Microsoft Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge "Microsoft Edge"),Â andÂ [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox "Firefox")Â for Windows.
