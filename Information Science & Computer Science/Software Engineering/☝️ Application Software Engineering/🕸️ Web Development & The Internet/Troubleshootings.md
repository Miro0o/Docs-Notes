## ðŸ‘‰ $color2: "var(--accent-color)" is not a color for 'mix' | Dark Mode | Interaction of SCSS and CSS Variables
#scss #css #dark_mode #web_front_end

I want to achieve such effect that my web switch dark /light mode automatically. This usually involves the use of `@media (prefer-color-scheme: dark){}`. However the actual case is a bit complicated when there also involves SCSS variables like `$base01: #000` and CSS variables like `--base01: #000`. The article below exactly reports what i encountered and gives a solution.  

> ðŸ”— [Dark mode, and the interaction of SCSS and CSS variables](https://prose.nsood.in/dark-mode-scss)

The main problem here is that when using SCSS variables in Sass, variables are compile-time, whereas CSS variables are run-time. So one cannot write such code to make CSS change in-the-fly, i.e. after they were loaded to the browser:
```css
$bgColor: #fff;
body {
	background-color: $bgColor;
}
@media(prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
	$bgColor: #000;
	...
}
```
Instead the author write following code and he succeeded: 
```css
$fadeColorLight: #999;
$fadeColorDark: #99b;

:root {
	--fadeColor: #{$fadeColorLight};
	--faintFadeColor: #{lighten($fadeColorLight, 15%)};
}

a {
	...
	background-image: linear-gradient(
		transparent 80%, 
		var(--faintFadeColor) 80%,
		var(--faintFadeColor) 87.5%,
		transparent 87.5%
	);
	...
}

@media(prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
	:root {
		--fadeColor: #{$fadeColorDark};
		--faintFadeColor: #{lighten($fadeColorDark, 15%)};
	}
}
```
âš  NOTE: the weirdÂ `#{}`Â syntax for assigning SCSS values to CSS variables is due to a SCSS syntax incompatibility with CSS variables requiring any invalid CSS be produced literally:Â [https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/1128](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/1128)

And i didn't noticed the `#{}` syntax here and i simply put var(--variable) which leads to the error: ` $color2: "var(--accent-color)" is not a color for 'mix'`, where the `mix` refers to the css function of mixing two colors: `mix($color1, $color2, $percentage)`

## ðŸ‘‰ `jekyll-pagination` not working
#jekyll #github_pages

My `jekyll-pagination` plugin is not working on my github pages. Here's how i solve this problem:
1. First i thought i was because i didn't installed `jekyll-pagination` correctly. So i looked up Jekyll docs for installing plugins. It mentions two useful information:
	1. Github Pages has restriction on legal plugins: ðŸ”— [whitelisted plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions). However `jekyll-pagination` is on the list.
	2. Github Pages enabled `--safe` option by defaults. Which means only those explicitly listed plugins (on whitelist) work properly.
2. However those are not solving my problem. So i dig deeper, and i found these information:
	1. `jekyll-paginator` only looks into `index.html` file under root directory and the YAML front matter of that `index.html` must include `paginate: true`
	2. In `_config.yaml` one should add `paginate_path: ./page:num/` if the `index.html` file is under the project's root directory, i.e. the same level as the `_config.yaml` file.
	3. Jekyll's pagination plugin is very "picky" as indicated in ðŸ”— [this github issues](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/discussions/3292#discussion-3757810) and the author gave below possible reasons: (directly quote)
		1. You technically have two "home" pages...Â [`index.html`](https://github.com/adamdjbrett/doctrineofdiscovery.org/blob/master/index.html)Â andÂ [`home3.html`](https://github.com/adamdjbrett/doctrineofdiscovery.org#:~:text=3%20years%20ago-,home3.html,-updating%20homepage)... removeÂ `home3.html`
		2. RemoveÂ `permalink: /`Â fromÂ `index.html`. It's not needed since it's already in the root, and by setting it asÂ `/`Â it's confusing the paginator.
		3. Remove all of the Liquid you added afterÂ `{% include feature_row %}`. It's not needed since you're already usingÂ `layout: home`on that page which has it. This is causing a duplication of "recent posts" on that page.
		4. You may want to removeÂ `/_pages/LICENSE.md`Â as well since it doesn't have any front matter and is outputting an extraÂ `index.html`Â inÂ `_pages`Â which may or may not be trouble for Jekyll's paginator.
3. I followed above instructions and finally my page is working! Though I still don't quite know what went wrong... :)

My few cents to @wsgeorge answer. Assuming that you installedÂ [jekyll-paginate](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate)Â notÂ [jekyll-paginate-v2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2)
1. Remember to renameÂ `index.md`Â toÂ `index.html`
2. AddÂ `paginate: true`Â toÂ `index.html`
    ```xml
    ---
    layout: home
    paginate: true
    ---
    ```
3. Add following toÂ `_config.yaml`
    ```xml
    paginate: 5
    paginate_path: ./page:num/
    ```
    **Notice:**Â **.**Â (period) inÂ `./page:num/`Â path - this indicates that myÂ `index.html`Â file is in the root directory (directory along/next to Gemfile).

Vercel is mainly hosting frontend projects. For a single express app there are 2 ways to host: the first making it a serviceless app and the secod deploy it all-in-one. 

Here the later approach is adopted. To acomplish that a ``vercel.json  file is needed to configure the hosting service the right way.
