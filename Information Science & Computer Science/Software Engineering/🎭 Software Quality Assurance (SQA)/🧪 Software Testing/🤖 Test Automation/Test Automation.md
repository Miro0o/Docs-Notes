## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation#Continuous_testing

In [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing), **test automation** is the use of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) separate from the software being tested to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) and [continuous testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_testing).
There are many approaches to test automation, however below are the general approaches used widely:
- GUI 🆚 API
	- **[Graphical user interface testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface_testing)**. A testing framework that generates [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) events such as keystrokes and mouse clicks, and observes the changes that result in the user interface, to validate that the observable behavior of the program is correct.
	- **[API driven testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_testing)**. A testing framework that uses a programming interface to the application to validate the behaviour under test. Typically API driven testing bypasses application user interface altogether. It can also be testing [public (usually) interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interface) to classes, modules or libraries are tested with a variety of input arguments to validate that the results that are returned are correct.
- CI/CD and Continuous Testing (🆚 Independant Testing)
	- [**Continuous testing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_testing). Continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate. For Continuous Testing, the scope of testing extends from validating bottom-up requirements or user stories to assessing the system requirements associated with overarching business goals
