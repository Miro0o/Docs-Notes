## Intro
Service meshes manage traffic (i.e. communication) between services. They enable platform teams to add reliability, observability, and security features uniformly across all services running within a cluster without requiring any code changes.

Along with Kubernetes, service meshes have become some of the most critical infrastructure components of the cloud native stack.
