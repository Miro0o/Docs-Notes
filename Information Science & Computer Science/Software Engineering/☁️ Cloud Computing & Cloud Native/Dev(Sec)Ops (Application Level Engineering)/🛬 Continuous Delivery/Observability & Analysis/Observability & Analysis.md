## Intro
Before diving into these categories, let's first define observability and analysis. Observability is a system characteristic describing the degree to which a system can be understood from its external outputs. Measured by CPU time, memory, disk space, latency, errors, etc., computer systems can be more or less observable. Analysis is an activity in which you look at this observable data and make sense of it.

To ensure there is no service disruption, you'll need to observe and analyze every aspect of your application so every anomaly gets detected and rectified right away. This is what this category is all about. It runs across and observes all layers which is why it's on the side and not embedded in a specific layer.

Tools in this category are broken down into logging, monitoring, tracing, and chaos engineering. Please note that the category name is somewhat misleading — although chaos engineering is listed here, consider it a reliability tool rather than an observability or analysis tool.
