[Can I compile and debug (run) a single C++ file in Visual Studio 2012? (How to avoid creating too many projects) | Stackoverflow]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/16626536/16542494

While trying to figure out how to use Visual Studio for the very same purpose you asked, I observed and found that for a C++ project, there should be only one starting point, that is, only one `main()` function.
