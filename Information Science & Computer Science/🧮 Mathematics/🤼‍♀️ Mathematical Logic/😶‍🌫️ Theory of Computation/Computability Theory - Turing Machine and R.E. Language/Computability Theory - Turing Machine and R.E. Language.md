**Computability theory**, also known as **recursion theory**, is a branch of [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and the [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation "Theory of computation") that originated in the 1930s with the study of [computable functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_function "Computable function") and [Turing degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_degree "Turing degree"). The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized [computability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability "Computability") and [definability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definable_set "Definable set"). In these areas, computability theory overlaps with [proof theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory "Proof theory") and [effective descriptive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_descriptive_set_theory "Effective descriptive set theory").

Basic questions addressed by computability theory include:
-   What does it mean for a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") on the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") to be computable?
-   How can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?

Although there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematical computability theorists study the theory of relative computability, reducibility notions, and degree structures; those in the computer science field focus on the theory of [subrecursive hierarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory"), [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_method "Formal method"), and [formal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language").
