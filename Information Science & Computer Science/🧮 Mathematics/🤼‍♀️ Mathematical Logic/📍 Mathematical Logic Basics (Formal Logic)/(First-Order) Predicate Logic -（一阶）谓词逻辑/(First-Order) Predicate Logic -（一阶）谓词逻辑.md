**First-order logic**, also called **predicate logic**, **predicate calculus**, or **quantificational logic**, is a collection of [formal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system") used in [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"). First-order logic uses [quantified variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_\(logic\) "Quantification (logic)") over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables. Rather than propositions such as "all humans are mortal", in first-order logic one can have expressions in the form "for all _x_, if _x_ is a human, then _x_ is mortal", where "for all _x"_ is a quantifier, _x_ is a variable, and "... _is a human_" and "... _is mortal_" are predicates. This distinguishes it from [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic"), which does not use quantifiers or [relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary_relation "Finitary relation");  in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.

A theory about a topic, such as [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory"), a theory for groups, or a formal theory of [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic"), is usually a first-order logic together with a specified [domain of discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse "Domain of discourse") (over which the quantified variables range), finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many [predicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_\(mathematical_logic\) "Predicate (mathematical logic)") defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold about them. "Theory" is sometimes understood in a more formal sense as just a set of sentences in first-order logic.

The term "first-order" distinguishes first-order logic from [higher-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_logic "Higher-order logic"), in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates, functions, or both, are permitted.  In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.

There are many [deductive systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_system "Deductive system") for first-order logic which are both [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness#Logical_systems "Soundness"), i.e. all provable statements are true in all models; and [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_\(logic\) "Completeness (logic)"), i.e. all statements which are true in all models are provable. Although the [logical consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence") relation is only [semidecidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidecidability "Semidecidability"), much progress has been made in [automated theorem proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving "Automated theorem proving") in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several [metalogical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalogic "Metalogic") theorems that make it amenable to analysis in [proof theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory "Proof theory"), such as the [Löwenheim–Skolem theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem "Löwenheim–Skolem theorem") and the [compactness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem "Compactness theorem").

First-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system"), and is studied in the [foundations of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics "Foundations of mathematics"). [Peano arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_arithmetic "Peano arithmetic") and [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory "Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory") are axiomatizations of [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory") and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic. No first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain, such as the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") or the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line"). Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures, i.e. [categorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_theory "Categorical theory") axiom systems, can be obtained in stronger logics such as [second-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_logic "Second-order logic").

The foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege "Gottlob Frege") and [Charles Sanders Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic#cite_note-5) For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see José Ferreirós (2001).
