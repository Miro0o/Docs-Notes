Among various methods of logical reasoning, deductive reasoning is deemed to be the best. Among various methods of deductive reasoning, classical logic (standard formal logic) lays the foundation of all other methods of deductions. 


### Classical Logic
> ðŸ”— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic

**Classical logic**Â (orÂ **standard logic**)Â orÂ **Fregeâ€“Russell logic)**Â is the intensively studied and most widely used class ofÂ [deductive logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning").Â Classical logic has had much influence onÂ [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy "Analytic philosophy").

Each logical system in this class shares characteristic properties:
1. [Law of excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle "Law of excluded middle")Â andÂ [double negation elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negation_elimination "Double negation elimination")
2. [Law of noncontradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction "Law of noncontradiction"), and theÂ [principle of explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion "Principle of explosion")
3. [Monotonicity of entailment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_of_entailment "Monotonicity of entailment")Â andÂ [idempotency of entailment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotency_of_entailment "Idempotency of entailment")
4. [Commutativity of conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutativity_of_conjunction "Commutativity of conjunction")
5. [De Morgan duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan_duality "De Morgan duality"): everyÂ [logical operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_operator "Logical operator")Â is dual to another

While not entailed by the preceding conditions, contemporary discussions of classical logic normally only includeÂ [propositional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus "Propositional calculus")Â andÂ [first-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic")Â logics.Â In other words, the overwhelming majority of time spent studying classical logic has been spent studying specifically propositional and first-order logic, as opposed to the other forms of classical logic.

Most semantics of classical logic areÂ [bivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence "Principle of bivalence"), meaning all of the possible denotations of propositions can be categorized as either true or false.
