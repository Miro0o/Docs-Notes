## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research

**Operations research** ([British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English_language): **operational research**), often shortened to the [initialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism) **OR**, is a discipline that deals with the development and application of analytical methods to improve **decision-making**. It is considered to be a subfield of [mathematical sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_sciences). The term [**management science**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_science) (or short for **MS**) is occasionally used as a synonym.

Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences, such as [modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), and [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization), operations research arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) problems. Because of its emphasis on practical applications, operations research has overlap with many other disciplines, notably [industrial engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering). Operations research is often concerned with determining the extreme values of some real-world objective: the [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima) (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of loss, risk, or cost). Originating in military efforts before [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries.

Operations research (OR) encompasses the development and the use of a wide range of [problem-solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving") techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decision-making and efficiency, such as [simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation "Simulation"), [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization "Mathematical optimization"), [queueing theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory "Queueing theory") and other [stochastic-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process "Stochastic process") models, [Markov decision processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_Decision_Process "Markov Decision Process"), [econometric methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics "Econometrics"), [data envelopment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_envelopment_analysis "Data envelopment analysis"), [ordinal priority approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_Priority_Approach "Ordinal Priority Approach"), [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network"), [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_System "Expert System"), [decision analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis "Decision analysis"), and the [analytic hierarchy process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process "Analytic hierarchy process").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research#cite_note-4) Nearly all of these techniques involve the construction of mathematical models that attempt to describe the system. Because of the computational and statistical nature of most of these fields, OR also has strong ties to [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") and [analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics "Analytics"). Operational researchers faced with a new problem must determine which of these techniques are most appropriate given the nature of the system, the goals for improvement, and constraints on time and computing power, or develop a new technique specific to the problem at hand (and, afterwards, to that type of problem).
