**Game theory** is the study of [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") of strategic interactions. It has applications in many fields of [social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science"), and is used extensively in [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [systems science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_science "Systems science") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"). Initially, game theory addressed two-person [zero-sum games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game "Zero-sum game"), in which a participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. In the 1950s, it was extended to the study of non zero-sum games, and was eventually applied to a wide range of [behavioral relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_behavior "Human behavior"). It is now an [umbrella term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_term "Umbrella term") for the [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") of rational [decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making "Decision-making") in humans, animals, and computers.

Modern game theory began with the idea of [mixed-strategy equilibria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_Strategy_Equilibria "Mixed Strategy Equilibria") in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann"). Von Neumann's original proof used the [Brouwer fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem "Brouwer fixed-point theorem") on continuous mappings into compact [convex sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set "Convex set"), which became a standard method in game theory and [mathematical economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_economics "Mathematical economics"). His paper was followed by _[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Games_and_Economic_Behavior "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior")_ (1944), co-written with [Oskar Morgenstern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Morgenstern "Oskar Morgenstern"), which considered [cooperative games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory "Cooperative game theory") of several players. The second edition provided an [axiomatic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem "Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem") of [expected utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis "Expected utility hypothesis"), which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.

Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s, and was explicitly applied to [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. [John Maynard Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Smith "John Maynard Smith") was awarded the [Crafoord Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crafoord_Prize "Crafoord Prize") for his application of [evolutionary game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory "Evolutionary game theory") in 1999, and fifteen game theorists have won the [Nobel Prize in economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences "Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences") as of 2020, including most recently [Paul Milgrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Milgrom "Paul Milgrom") and [Robert B. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_B._Wilson "Robert B. Wilson").

Games can have several features, a few of the most common are listed here.
- **Number of players**: Each person who makes a choice in a game or who receives a payoff from the outcome of those choices is a player.
- **Strategies per player**: In a game each player chooses from a set of possible actions, known as pure strategies. If the number is the same for all players, it is listed here.
- **Number of [pure strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_strategy "Pure strategy") [Nash equilibria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibria "Nash equilibria")**: A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies which represents mutual [best responses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_response "Best response") to the other strategies. In other words, if every player is playing their part of a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. Considering only situations where players play a single strategy without randomizing (a pure strategy) a game can have any number of Nash equilibria.
- **[Sequential game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_game "Sequential game")**: A game is sequential if one player performs their actions after another player; otherwise, the game is a [simultaneous move game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_game "Simultaneous game").
- **[Perfect information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_information "Perfect information")**: A game has perfect information if it is a sequential game and every player knows the strategies chosen by the players who preceded them.
- **[Constant sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_sum "Constant sum")**: A game is a constant sum game if the sum of the payoffs to every player are the same for every single set of strategies. In these games, one player gains if and only if another player loses. A constant sum game can be converted into a [zero sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_sum "Zero sum") game by subtracting a fixed value from all payoffs, leaving their relative order unchanged.
- **[Move by nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_by_nature "Move by nature")**: A game includes a random move by nature.
