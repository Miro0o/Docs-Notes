## Intro
> ðŸ”— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization

**Mathematical optimization**Â (alternatively spelledÂ _optimisation_) orÂ **mathematical programming**Â is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criteria, from some set of available alternatives.Â It is generally divided into two subfields:Â [discrete optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_optimization "Discrete optimization")Â andÂ [continuous optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_optimization "Continuous optimization"). Optimization problems arise in all quantitative disciplines fromÂ [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science")Â andÂ [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering")Â toÂ [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research")Â andÂ [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), and the development of solution methods has been of interest inÂ [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics")Â for centuries.

In the more general approach, anÂ [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem "Optimization problem")Â consists ofÂ [maximizing or minimizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima "Maxima and minima")Â aÂ [real function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_a_real_variable "Function of a real variable")Â by systematically choosingÂ [input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function "Argument of a function")Â values from within an allowed set and computing theÂ [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_\(mathematics\) "Value (mathematics)")Â of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area ofÂ [applied mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics").
