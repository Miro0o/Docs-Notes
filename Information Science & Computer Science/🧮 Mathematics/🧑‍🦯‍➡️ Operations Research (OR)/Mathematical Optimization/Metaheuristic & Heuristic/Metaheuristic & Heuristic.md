## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") and [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization "Mathematical optimization"), a **metaheuristic** is a higher-level [procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_\(computer_science\) "Procedure (computer science)") or [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_\(computer_science\) "Heuristic (computer science)") designed to find, generate, tune, or select a heuristic (partial [search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm "Search algorithm")) that may provide a sufficiently good solution to an [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem "Optimization problem") or a [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") problem, especially with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity. Metaheuristics sample a subset of solutions which is otherwise too large to be completely enumerated or otherwise explored. Metaheuristics may make relatively few assumptions about the optimization problem being solved and so may be usable for a variety of problems. Their use is always of interest when exact or other (approximate) methods are not available or are not expedient, either because the calculation time is too long or because, for example, the solution provided is too imprecise.

Compared to [optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_algorithm "Optimization algorithm") and [iterative methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method "Iterative method"), metaheuristics do not guarantee that a [globally optimal solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimum "Global optimum") can be found on some class of problems. Many metaheuristics implement some form of [stochastic optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_optimization "Stochastic optimization"), so that the solution found is dependent on the set of [random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable") generated. In [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization "Combinatorial optimization"), there are many problems that belong to the class of [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness "NP-completeness") problems and thus can no longer be solved exactly in an acceptable time from a relatively low degree of complexity. Metaheuristics then often provide good solutions with less computational effort than approximation methods, iterative methods, or simple heuristics. This also applies in the field of continuous or mixed-integer optimization. As such, metaheuristics are useful approaches for optimization problems. Several books and survey papers have been published on the subject. Literature review on metaheuristic optimization, suggested that it was Fred Glover who coined the word metaheuristics.

Most literature on metaheuristics is experimental in nature, describing empirical results based on [computer experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_experiment "Computer experiment") with the algorithms. But some formal theoretical results are also available, often on [convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_\(mathematics\) "Convergence (mathematics)") and the possibility of finding the global optimum. Also worth mentioning are the [no-free-lunch theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem "No free lunch theorem"), which state that there can be no metaheuristic that is better than all others for any given problem.

Especially since the turn of the millennium, many metaheuristic methods have been published with claims of novelty and practical efficacy. While the field also features high-quality research, many of the more recent publications have been of poor quality; flaws include vagueness, lack of conceptual elaboration, poor experiments, and ignorance of previous literature.
