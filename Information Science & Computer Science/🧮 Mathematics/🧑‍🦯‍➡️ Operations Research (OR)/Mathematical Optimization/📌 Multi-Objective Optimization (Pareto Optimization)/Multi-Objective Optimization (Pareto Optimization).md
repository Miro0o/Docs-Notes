## Intro

**Multi-objective optimization** or **Pareto optimization** (also known as **multi-objective programming**, **vector optimization**, **multi-criteria optimization**, or **multi-attribute optimization**) is an area of [multiple-criteria decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCDM "MCDM") that is concerned with [mathematical optimization problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization "Mathematical optimization") involving more than one [objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function "Loss function") to be optimized simultaneously. Multi-objective is a type of [vector optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_optimization "Vector optimization") that has been applied in many fields of science, including engineering, economics and logistics where optimal decisions need to be taken in the presence of [trade-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-off "Trade-off") between two or more conflicting objectives. Minimizing cost while maximizing comfort while buying a car, and maximizing performance whilst minimizing fuel consumption and emission of pollutants of a vehicle are examples of multi-objective optimization problems involving two and three objectives, respectively. In practical problems, there can be more than three objectives.

For a multi-objective optimization problem, it is not guaranteed that a single solution simultaneously optimizes each objective. The objective functions are said to be conflicting. A solution is called [non-dominated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_of_a_point_set "Maxima of a point set"), Pareto optimal, [Pareto efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficient "Pareto efficient") or non-inferior, if none of the objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other objective values. Without additional [subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity "Subjectivity") preference information, there may exist a (possibly infinite) number of Pareto optimal solutions, all of which are considered equally good. Researchers study multi-objective optimization problems from different viewpoints and, thus, there exist different solution philosophies and goals when setting and solving them. The goal may be to find a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions, and/or quantify the trade-offs in satisfying the different objectives, and/or finding a single solution that satisfies the subjective preferences of a human decision maker (DM).

**Bi-criteria optimization** denotes the special case in which there are two objective functions.

There is a direct relationship between [multitask optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitask_optimization "Multitask optimization") and multi-objective optimization.
