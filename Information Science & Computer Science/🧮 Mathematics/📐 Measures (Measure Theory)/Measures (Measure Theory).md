InÂ [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), the concept of aÂ **measure**Â is a generalization and formalization ofÂ [geometrical measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_measures "Geometrical measures")Â ([length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length "Length"),Â [area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area "Area"),Â [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume")) and other common notions, such asÂ [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_\(mathematics\) "Magnitude (mathematics)"),Â [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass"), andÂ [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability")Â of events. These seemingly distinct concepts have many similarities and can often be treated together in a single mathematical context. Measures are foundational inÂ [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"),Â [integration theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral"), and can be generalized to assumeÂ [negative values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_measure "Signed measure"), as withÂ [electrical charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_charge "Electrical charge"). Far-reaching generalizations (such asÂ [spectral measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_measure "Spectral measure")Â andÂ [projection-valued measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection-valued_measure "Projection-valued measure")) of measure are widely used inÂ [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_physics "Quantum physics")Â and physics in general.

The intuition behind this concept dates back toÂ [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), whenÂ [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes "Archimedes")Â tried to calculate theÂ [area of a circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_a_circle "Area of a circle").Â But it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that measure theory became a branch of mathematics. The foundations of modern measure theory were laid in the works ofÂ [Ã‰mile Borel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel "Ã‰mile Borel"),Â [Henri Lebesgue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue "Henri Lebesgue"),Â [Nikolai Luzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Luzin "Nikolai Luzin"),Â [Johann Radon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Radon "Johann Radon"),Â [Constantin CarathÃ©odory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin_Carath%C3%A9odory "Constantin CarathÃ©odory"), andÂ [Maurice FrÃ©chet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Fr%C3%A9chet "Maurice FrÃ©chet"), among others.
