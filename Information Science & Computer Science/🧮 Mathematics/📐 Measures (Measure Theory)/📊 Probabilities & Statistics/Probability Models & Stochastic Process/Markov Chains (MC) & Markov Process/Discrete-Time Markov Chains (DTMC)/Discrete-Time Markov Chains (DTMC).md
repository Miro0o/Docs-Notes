This tutorial will introduce you to the PRISM tool using a selection of example models.
The tutorial comprises several parts. If you are new to the tool, we recommend that you start by working through the first part (Knuth's die algorithm) to see the basics. After that, you should be able to look at the remaining parts in any order, depending in which models or applications you are interested in. If anything is unclear, the best place to look for answers is the [PRISM manual](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/).
- **[Knuth's die algorithm](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/tutorial/die.php)**: This uses a simple **discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC)** example - a randomised algorithm for modelling a 6-sided die with a fair coin due to Don Knuth. It introduces the basics of the PRISM modelling language and the PRISM tool.  
- **[Herman's self-stabilisation algorithm](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/tutorial/herman.php)**: This uses another simple randomised algorithm: a self-stabilisation algorithm due to Herman. This is also modelled as a **DTMC** and introduces some additional features of the **PRISM modelling** and property languages. 
- **[EGL contract signing protocol](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/tutorial/egl.php)**: This uses a case study from the field of **computer security**, modelled as a **DTMC**: the EGL contract signing protocol.

## Intro
### Formal Definition of DMTC

#### Transient Distributions
Where is the Markov chain **after 1/2/3/…/n steps**?
**Answer**: in the transient distribution $\theta_n$

Two equivalent definitions / ways to compute :
1. $\theta_n = \iota \cdot P^n$
	1. Multiply the initial distribution vector by the transition probability matrix 𝑃𝑛 = make n-steps
2. $\begin{aligned} & \theta_0 = \iota \\ & \theta_{n+1} = \theta_n\cdot P\end{aligned}$ (Recursively)
	1. after 0-steps we’re at the initial distribution;
	2. after (n+1)-steps we’re at where we were after n-steps multiplied by the transition matrix
	3. ![](../../../../../../../Assets/Pics/Screenshot%202025-10-14%20at%2013.14.42.png)
#### Steady State Distribution
**Where is the Markov chain in the long term?** (where does it end?)
**Answer**: in the limit of $\theta_n$

Two ways to compute $\pi = 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡_{𝑛\to\infty}\theta_n$:
1. By iterative approximations -->  compute lots of transient distributions
2. As the (unique) stationary distribution, i.e. a distribution that satisfies $\pi = \pi \cdot 𝑃$ -->  **a “fixpoint” condition**
	1. ![](../../../../../../../Assets/Pics/Screenshot%202025-10-14%20at%2013.33.26.png)
	2. $\pi = \pi \cdot 𝑃 \Leftrightarrow \pi - \pi \cdot 𝑃 = 0 \Leftrightarrow \pi(I - P) = 0$
		1. $lim_{n\to\infty}\theta_n =lim_{n\to\infty}(\iota \cdot P^n) = \pi$
		2. $det(\pi) = det(lim_{n\to\infty}(\iota \cdot P^n)) = 0 \Leftrightarrow lim_{n\to\infty}(det(\iota \cdot P^n))=0$ (?)
		3. ↗ [Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, and Invariant Subspaces](../../../../../🧊%20Algebra/🎃%20Algebraic%20Structure%20&%20Abstract%20Algebra%20&%20Modern%20Algebra/Module-Like%20Algebraic%20Structure/Linear%20Algebra/Eigenvalues,%20Eigenvectors,%20and%20Invariant%20Subspaces/Eigenvalues,%20Eigenvectors,%20and%20Invariant%20Subspaces.md)

It's not always that the limit $\pi = 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡_{𝑛\to\infty}\theta_n$ is well defined and can be computed as the (unique) stationary distribution $\pi = \pi \cdot 𝑃$:
There are **cases** where :
- the limit is simply not well-defined;
- the limit depends on the initial distribution;
- the stationary distribution is not unique (the equation has more than 1 solution).

	- ![](../../../../../../../Assets/Pics/Screenshot%202025-10-14%20at%2013.35.59.png)


For the limit $\pi = 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡_{𝑛\to\infty}\theta_𝑛$ to be computed as the (unique) stationary distribution $\pi = \pi \cdot 𝑃$ of the DTMC $T$, there exist **sufficient conditions** ($\implies$):
1. $T$ must be **aperiodic**
	1. $T$ is aperiodic if the GCD of all cycle lengths is 1—check stats.stackexchange.com/a/48861
2. $T$ must be **strongly connected**.

If (1) and (2) do not hold: pay attention to the computation of steady states, because it may not mean what you have in mind.
If (1) and (2) hold, we can compute the limit precisely and independently of the initial distribution.
