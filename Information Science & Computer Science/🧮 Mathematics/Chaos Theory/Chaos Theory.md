## Intro

**Chaos theory** is an [interdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinary) area of [scientific study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_study) and branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) focused on underlying patterns and deterministic [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law) of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) that are highly sensitive to [initial conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_conditions), and were once thought to have completely random states of disorder and irregularities.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory#cite_note-1) Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness of [chaotic complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaotic_complex_system), there are underlying patterns, interconnection, constant [feedback loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_loops), repetition, [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity), [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractals), and [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization).
