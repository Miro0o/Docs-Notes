**Functional analysis** is a branch of [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis"), the core of which is formed by the study of [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (for example, [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space#Definition "Inner product space"), [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_\(mathematics\)#Definition "Norm (mathematics)"), or [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space#Definitions "Topological space")) and the [linear functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation "Linear transformation") defined on these spaces and suitably respecting these structures. The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of [spaces of functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space "Function space") and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform "Fourier transform") as transformations defining, for example, [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function") or [unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_operator "Unitary operator") operators between function spaces. This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations "Differential equations") and [integral equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equations "Integral equations").

The usage of the word _[functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_\(mathematics\) "Functional (mathematics)")_ as a noun goes back to the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations "Calculus of variations"), implying a [function whose argument is a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function "Higher-order function"). The term was first used in [Hadamard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard "Jacques Hadamard")'s 1910 book on that subject. However, the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 by the Italian mathematician and physicist [Vito Volterra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Volterra "Vito Volterra"). The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of Hadamard, in particular [Fréchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Maurice_Fr%C3%A9chet "René Maurice Fréchet") and [Lévy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_L%C3%A9vy_\(mathematician\) "Paul Lévy (mathematician)"). Hadamard also founded the modern school of linear functional analysis further developed by [Riesz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigyes_Riesz "Frigyes Riesz") and the [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w_School_of_Mathematics "Lwów School of Mathematics") of [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland") mathematicians around [Stefan Banach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach "Stefan Banach").

In modern introductory texts on functional analysis, the subject is seen as the study of vector spaces endowed with a topology, in particular [infinite-dimensional spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_\(vector_space\) "Dimension (vector space)"). In contrast, [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") deals mostly with finite-dimensional spaces, and does not use topology. An important part of functional analysis is the extension of the theories of [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_\(mathematics\) "Measure (mathematics)"), [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral"), and [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") to infinite-dimensional spaces, also known as **infinite dimensional analysis**.
