Any propositional formula can be turned to a case analysis on a single atomic proposition by using the following equivalence-preserving transformation (also known as **Shannon expansion**.)

A Boolean function can be represented as aÂ [rooted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooted_graph "Rooted graph"), directed, acyclicÂ [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), which consists of several (decision) nodes and two terminal nodes. The two terminal nodes are labeled 0 ($FALSE$) and 1 ($TRUE$). Each (decision) nodeÂ $u$Â is labeled by a Boolean variableÂ $x_i$Â and has twoÂ [child nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_node "Child node")Â called low child and high child. The edge from nodeÂ $u$Â to a low (or high) child represents an assignment of the value $FALSE$ (or $TRUE$, respectively) to variableÂ $x_i$. Such aÂ **BDD**Â is called '**ordered**' if different variables appear in the same order on all paths from the root. A BDD is said to be '**reduced**' if the following two rules have been applied to its graph:
- Merge anyÂ [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism "Graph isomorphism")Â subgraphs.
- Eliminate any node whose two children are isomorphic.

In popular usage, the termÂ **BDD**Â almost always refers toÂ **Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram**Â (**ROBDD**Â in the literature, used when the ordering and reduction aspects need to be emphasized). ==The advantage of an ROBDD is that it is canonical (unique up to isomorphism) for a particular function and variable order.==Â This property makes it useful in functional equivalence checking and other operations like functional technology mapping.

A path from the root node to the 1-terminal represents a (possibly partial) variable assignment for which the represented Boolean function is true. As the path descends to a low (or high) child from a node, then that node's variable is assigned to 0 (respectively 1).
