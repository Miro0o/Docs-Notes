## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_CTL

**Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic** (PCTL) is an extension of [computation tree logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic "Computation tree logic") (CTL) that allows for [probabilistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic "Probabilistic") [quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_\(logic\) "Quantification (logic)") of described properties. It has been defined in the paper by Hansson and Jonsson.

PCTL is a useful [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") for stating soft deadline properties, e.g. "after a request for a service, there is at least a 98% probability that the service will be carried out within 2 seconds". Akin CTL suitability for [model-checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-checking "Model-checking") PCTL extension is widely used as a [property specification language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_Specification_Language "Property Specification Language") for probabilistic model checkers.
