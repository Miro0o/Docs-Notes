### Computation Tree Logics CTL*
Temporal logics may differ according to how they handle branching in the underlying computation tree:
- In a **‚Üó [Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)](Linear%20Temporal%20Logic%20(LTL).md)**, operators are provided for describing events along a single computation path. 
- In a **‚Üó [Branching Time Logic (Computation-Tree Logic, CTL)](Branching%20Time%20Logic%20(Computation-Tree%20Logic,%20CTL).md)** the temporal operators quantify over the paths that are possible from a given state.

The **computation tree logic CTL\***(NOTICE FOR THE PRIME) combines both branching-time and linear-time operators.

### Syntax & Notation of CTL*
**Notation**
In this logic a **path quantifier** can prefix an assertion composed of arbitrary combinations of the usual linear-time operators.
- For a state $s$ we define the **set of all paths** starting from $s$, as the set of all **maximal executions** starting from $s$: $Paths(s) = \{s_0, s_1, s_2, ... ‚à£ s_0=s \text{ and } s_i \to s_{i+1}\}$
	- For a path $\pi = s_0, s_1, s_2, ‚Ä¶$ we define the $(i-1)$-th state by $\pi[i]=s_i$
	- We can also define the prefix starting at the $(i-1)$-th state $\pi[i...]=s_i, s_{i+1}, ...$
- We define the ==satisfaction set== of an LTL or CTL formula as the set of states that satisfy the formula $sat(\phi) = \{s ‚à£ s \models \phi\}$
	- ‚Üó [(Formal) Model Checking](../../../../../CyberSecurity/üè∞%20Cybersecurity%20Basics%20&%20InfoSec/üç¶%20Software%20Security/ü™Ü%20Software%20Analysis%20&%20Binary%20Engineering/üìå%20Software%20Analysis%20Basics/üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è%20Formal%20Methods%20&%20Formal%20Verification%20(FV)/(Formal)%20Model%20Checking/(Formal)%20Model%20Checking.md)
	- We say that a transition system ($T$) satisfies a formula ($\phi$) if all its initial states ($s\in I$) satisfy the formula:
		- $T\models\phi \iff \forall s\in I. s \models\phi$
	- or, equivalently:
		- $T\models\phi \iff I\subseteq sat(\phi)$
- Path quantifier:
	- $A / \forall$ -- ‚Äúfor every path‚Äù
	- $E / \exists$ -- ‚Äúthere exists a path‚Äù
- Linear-time operators:
	- $X_p$ -- $p$ holds next time /state
	- $F_p$ -- $p$ holds sometime in the future
	- $G_p$ -- $p$ holds globally in the future
	- $_pU_q$ -- $p$ holds until $q$ holds

**Syntax**
The grammar of CTL* has the same state formulas as CTL‚Ä¶ $$\phi ::= true ‚à£ p ‚à£ \neg\phi ‚à£ \phi_1\lor\phi_2 ‚à£ \exists\psi ‚à£ \forall\psi$$
‚Ä¶ but (subtly) extended path formulas (akin to LTL) $$\psi ::= \bigcirc\psi ‚à£ \diamondsuit\psi ‚à£ \Box\psi ‚à£ \psi_1\cup\psi_2 ‚à£ \neg\psi ‚à£ \psi_1\lor\psi_2 ‚à£ \phi$$
Main differences:
- no need to interleave quantifiers with temporal operators
- All state formulas are also path formulas

> LTL formulas can be seen as CTL* formulas of the form $\forall\psi$ where $\psi$ is a path formula **without path quantifiers**

### Expressive Power of CTL, LTL, and CTL*
It can be shown that the three logics discussed in this section have different expressive powers. 

For example, there is no CTL formula that is equivalent to the LTL formula $A(FG p)$ .
Likewise, there is no LTL formula that is equivalent to the CTL formula $AG(EF p)$ .
The disjunction $A(FGp)\lor AG(EFp)$ is a CTL* formula that is not expressible in either CTL or LTL.
