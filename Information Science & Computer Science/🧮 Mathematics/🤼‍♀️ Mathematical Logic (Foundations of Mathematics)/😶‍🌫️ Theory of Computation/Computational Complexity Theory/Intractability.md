A problem that can theoretically be solved, but requires impractical and infinite resources (e.g., time) to do so, is known as anÂ _**intractable problem**_.Â Conversely, a problem that can be solved in practice is called aÂ _**tractable problem**_, literally "a problem that can be handled". The termÂ _[infeasible](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infeasible "wikt:infeasible")_Â (literally "cannot be done") is sometimes used interchangeably withÂ _[intractable](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intractable "wikt:intractable")_,Â though this risks confusion with aÂ [feasible solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_solution "Feasible solution")Â inÂ [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization "Mathematical optimization").

Tractable problems are frequently identified with problems that have polynomial-time solutions (P![{\displaystyle {\textsf {P}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec84dd832febb10256f66e1d1812aced47e07c4c),Â PTIME); this is known as theÂ [Cobhamâ€“Edmonds thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobham%E2%80%93Edmonds_thesis "Cobhamâ€“Edmonds thesis"). Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that areÂ [EXPTIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXPTIME "EXPTIME")-hard. IfÂ NPÂ is not the same asÂ P![{\displaystyle {\textsf {P}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec84dd832febb10256f66e1d1812aced47e07c4c), thenÂ [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard "NP-hard")Â problems are also intractable in this sense.

However, this identification is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large degree or large leading coefficient grows quickly, and may be impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that takes a long time in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not inÂ PÂ does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem inÂ [Presburger arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic "Presburger arithmetic")Â has been shown not to be inÂ P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-completeÂ [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem "Knapsack problem")Â over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time andÂ [SAT solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT_solver "SAT solver")Â routinely handle large instances of the NP-completeÂ [Boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem "Boolean satisfiability problem").
