**Combinatory logic** is a notation to eliminate the need for [quantified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifier_\(logic\) "Quantifier (logic)") variables in [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"). It was introduced by [Moses Schönfinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sch%C3%B6nfinkel "Moses Schönfinkel") and [Haskell Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry "Haskell Curry"), and has more recently been used in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") as a theoretical [model of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation "Model of computation") and also as a basis for the design of [functional programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming_languages "Functional programming languages"). It is based on **combinators**, which were introduced by [Schönfinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sch%C3%B6nfinkel "Moses Schönfinkel") in 1920 with the idea of providing an analogous way to build up functions—and to remove any mention of variables—particularly in [predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic "Predicate logic"). A combinator is a [higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function "Higher-order function") that uses only [function application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_application "Function application") and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments.
