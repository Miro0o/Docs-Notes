A special type of binary relation, called an **equivalence relation**, captures the notion of two objects being equal in some feature. A binary relation $R$ is an equivalence relation if $R$ satisfies three conditions:
1. $R$ is reflexive if for every $x$, $xRx$;
2. $R$ is symmetric if for every $x$ and $y$, $xRy$ implies $yRx$;
3. $R$ is transitive if for every $x$, $y$, and $z$, $xRy$ and $yRz$ implies $xRz$.
