**Set theory** is the branch of [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic") that studies [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_\(mathematics\) "Set (mathematics)"), which can be informally described as collections of objects. Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory – as a branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") – is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.

**The modern study of set theory was initiated by the German mathematicians [Richard Dedekind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind "Richard Dedekind") and [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor "Georg Cantor") in the 1870s.** In particular, Georg Cantor is commonly considered the founder of set theory. The non-formalized systems investigated during this early stage go under the name of _[naive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory "Naive set theory")_. After the discovery of [paradoxes within naive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxes_of_set_theory "Paradoxes of set theory") (such as [Russell's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox "Russell's paradox"), [Cantor's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_paradox "Cantor's paradox") and the [Burali-Forti paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burali-Forti_paradox "Burali-Forti paradox")), various [axiomatic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system") were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory "Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory") (with or without the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice "Axiom of choice")) is still the best-known and most studied.

==Set theory is commonly employed as a [foundational system for the whole of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_of_mathematics "Foundation of mathematics"), particularly in the form of **Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory** with the axiom of choice.== Besides its foundational role, set theory also provides the framework to develop a mathematical theory of [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity "Infinity"), and has various applications in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") (such as in the theory of [relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra "Relational algebra")), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [formal semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_\(computer_science\) "Semantics (computer science)"), and [evolutionary dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_dynamics "Evolutionary dynamics"). Its foundational appeal, together with its [paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxes "Paradoxes"), and its implications for the concept of infinity and its multiple applications have made set theory an area of major interest for [logicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and [philosophers of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics "Philosophy of mathematics"). Contemporary research into set theory covers a vast array of topics, ranging from the structure of the [real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") line to the study of the [consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency") of [large cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_cardinal "Large cardinal").
