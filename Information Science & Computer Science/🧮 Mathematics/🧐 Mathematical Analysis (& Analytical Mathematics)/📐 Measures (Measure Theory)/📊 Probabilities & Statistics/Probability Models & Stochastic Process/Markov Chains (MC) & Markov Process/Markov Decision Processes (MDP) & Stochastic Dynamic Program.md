**Markov decision process** (**MDP**), also called a [stochastic dynamic program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_dynamic_programming "Stochastic dynamic programming") or stochastic control problem, is a model for [sequential decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_decision_making "Sequential decision making") when [outcomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_\(probability\) "Outcome (probability)") are uncertain.

Originating from [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research") in the 1950s, MDPs have since gained recognition in a variety of fields, including [ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology "Ecology"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care "Health care"), [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications "Telecommunications") and [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning "Reinforcement learning"). Reinforcement learning utilizes the MDP framework to model the interaction between a learning agent and its environment. In this framework, the interaction is characterized by states, actions, and rewards. The MDP framework is designed to provide a simplified representation of key elements of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") challenges. This modeling framework incorporates the understanding of [cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality"), the management of uncertainty and nondeterminism, and the pursuit of explicit goals.

The name comes from its connection to [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain "Markov chain"), a concept developed by the Russian mathematician [Andrey Markov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov "Andrey Markov"). The "Markov" in "Markov decision process" refers to the underlying structure of [state transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_system "Transition system") that still follow the [Markov property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property "Markov property"). The process is called a "decision process" because it involves making decisions that influence these state transitions, extending the concept of a Markov chain into the realm of decision-making under uncertainty.
