**Estimation theory** is a branch of [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") that deals with estimating the values of [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parameter "Statistical parameter") based on measured empirical data that has a random component. The parameters describe an underlying physical setting in such a way that their value affects the distribution of the measured data. An _[estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator "Estimator")_ attempts to approximate the unknown parameters using the measurements. In estimation theory, two approaches are generally considered:
- The probabilistic approach (described in this article) assumes that the measured data is random with a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution") dependent on the parameters of interest
- The [set-membership approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_estimation "Set estimation") assumes that the measured data vector belongs to a set which depends on the parameter vector.
