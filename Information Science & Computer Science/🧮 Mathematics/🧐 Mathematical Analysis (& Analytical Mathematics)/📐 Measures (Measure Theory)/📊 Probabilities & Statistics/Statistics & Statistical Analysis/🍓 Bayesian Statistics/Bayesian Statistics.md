**Bayesian statistics** ([/ˈbeɪziən/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_BAY-zee-ən_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key") or [/ˈbeɪʒən/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_BAY-zhən_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) is a theory in the field of [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") based on the [Bayesian interpretation of probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability "Bayesian probability"), where [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability") expresses a _degree of belief_ in an [event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_\(probability_theory\) "Event (probability theory)"). The degree of belief may be based on prior knowledge about the event, such as the results of previous experiments, or on personal beliefs about the event. This differs from a number of other [interpretations of probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretations "Probability interpretations"), such as the [frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability "Frequentist probability") interpretation, which views probability as the [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence "Limit of a sequence") of the relative frequency of an event after many trials. More concretely, analysis in Bayesian methods codifies prior knowledge in the form of a [prior distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_distribution "Prior distribution").

Bayesian statistical methods use [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem "Bayes' theorem") to compute and update probabilities after obtaining new data. Bayes' theorem describes the [conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability "Conditional probability") of an event based on data as well as prior information or beliefs about the event or conditions related to the event. For example, in [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference "Bayesian inference"), Bayes' theorem can be used to estimate the parameters of a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution") or [statistical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model "Statistical model"). Since Bayesian statistics treats probability as a degree of belief, Bayes' theorem can directly assign a probability distribution that quantifies the belief to the parameter or set of parameters.

Bayesian statistics is named after [Thomas Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes "Thomas Bayes"), who formulated a specific case of Bayes' theorem in [a paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_Towards_Solving_a_Problem_in_the_Doctrine_of_Chances "An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances") published in 1763. In several papers spanning from the late 18th to the early 19th centuries, [Pierre-Simon Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace "Pierre-Simon Laplace") developed the Bayesian interpretation of probability. Laplace used methods now considered Bayesian to solve a number of statistical problems. While many Bayesian methods were developed by later authors, the term "Bayesian" was not commonly used to describe these methods until the 1950s. Throughout much of the 20th century, Bayesian methods were viewed unfavorably by many statisticians due to philosophical and practical considerations. Many of these methods required much computation, and most widely used approaches during that time were based on the frequentist interpretation. However, with the advent of powerful computers and new [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") like [Markov chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo "Markov chain Monte Carlo"), Bayesian methods have gained increasing prominence in statistics in the 21st century.
