**Statistical inference** is the process of using [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis "Data analysis") to infer properties of an underlying [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution"). **Inferential statistical analysis** infers properties of a [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population "Statistical population"), for example by **testing hypotheses** and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is [sampled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(statistics\) "Sampling (statistics)") from a larger population.

**Inferential statistics** can be contrasted with [descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics "Descriptive statistics"). Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population. In [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"), the term _inference_ is sometimes used instead to mean "make a prediction, by evaluating an already trained model"; in this context inferring properties of the model is referred to as _training_ or _learning_ (rather than _inference_), and using a model for prediction is referred to as _inference_ (instead of _prediction_); see also [predictive inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference "Predictive inference").


### Predictive Inference
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference#Prediction

Predictive inference is an approach to statistical inference that emphasizes the [prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction "Prediction") of future observations based on past observations.

Initially, predictive inference was based on _observable_ parameters and it was the main purpose of studying [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability "Probability"), but it fell out of favor in the 20th century due to a new parametric approach pioneered by [Bruno de Finetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_de_Finetti "Bruno de Finetti"). The approach modeled phenomena as a physical system observed with error (e.g., [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics "Celestial mechanics")). De Finetti's idea of [exchangeability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeability "Exchangeability")—that future observations should behave like past observations—came to the attention of the English-speaking world with the 1974 translation from French of his 1937 paper, and has since been propounded by such statisticians as [Seymour Geisser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Geisser "Seymour Geisser").
