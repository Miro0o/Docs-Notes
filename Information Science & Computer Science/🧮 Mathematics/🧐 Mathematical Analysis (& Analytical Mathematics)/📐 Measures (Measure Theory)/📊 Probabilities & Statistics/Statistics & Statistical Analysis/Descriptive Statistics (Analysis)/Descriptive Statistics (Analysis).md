A **descriptive statistic** (in the [count noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_noun "Count noun") sense) is a [summary statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_statistic "Summary statistic") that quantitatively describes or summarizes features from a collection of [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information"), while **descriptive statistics** (in the [mass noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_noun "Mass noun") sense) is the process of using and analysing those statistics. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from [inferential statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference "Statistical inference") (or inductive statistics) by its aim to summarize a [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_\(statistics\) "Sample (statistics)"), rather than use the data to learn about the [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population "Statistical population") that the sample of data is thought to represent. This generally means that descriptive statistics, unlike inferential statistics, is not developed on the basis of [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), and are frequently [nonparametric statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics "Nonparametric statistics"). Even when a data analysis draws its main conclusions using inferential statistics, descriptive statistics are generally also presented. For example, in papers reporting on human subjects, typically a table is included giving the overall [sample size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size "Sample size"), sample sizes in important subgroups (e.g., for each treatment or exposure group), and [demographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic "Demographic") or clinical characteristics such as the [average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average "Average") age, the proportion of subjects of each sex, the proportion of subjects with related [co-morbidities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity "Comorbidity"), etc.

Some measures that are commonly used to describe a data set are measures of [central tendency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency "Central tendency") and measures of variability or [dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion "Statistical dispersion"). Measures of central tendency include the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean "Mean"), [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median "Median") and [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_\(statistics\) "Mode (statistics)"), while measures of variability include the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation "Standard deviation") (or [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance "Variance")), the minimum and maximum values of the variables, [kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis "Kurtosis") and [skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness "Skewness").
