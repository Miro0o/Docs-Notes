## Intro
In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), a **Markov reward model** or **Markov reward process** is a stochastic process which extends either a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain "Markov chain") or [continuous-time Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous-time_Markov_chain "Continuous-time Markov chain") by adding a reward rate to each state. An additional variable records the reward accumulated up to the current time. Features of interest in the model include expected reward at a given time and expected time to accumulate a given reward. The model appears in [Ronald A. Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_A._Howard "Ronald A. Howard")'s book. The models are often studied in the context of [Markov decision processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process "Markov decision process") where a decision strategy can impact the rewards received.

The Markov Reward Model Checker tool can be used to numerically compute transient and stationary properties of Markov reward models.
