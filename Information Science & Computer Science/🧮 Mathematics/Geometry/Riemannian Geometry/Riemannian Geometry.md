**Riemannian geometry**Â is the branch ofÂ [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry")Â that studiesÂ [Riemannian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold"). An example of a Riemannian manifold is aÂ [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_\(mathematics\) "Surface (mathematics)"), on which distances are measured by the length of curves on the surface. Riemannian geometry is the study of surfaces and their higher-dimensional analogs (called manifolds), in which distances are calculated along curves belonging to the manifold. Formally, Riemannian geometry is the study ofÂ [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold")Â with aÂ _Riemannian metric_Â (anÂ [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product")Â on theÂ [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space")Â at each point that variesÂ [smoothly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function")Â from point to point). This gives, in particular, local notions ofÂ [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"),Â [length of curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length "Arc length"),Â [surface area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area "Surface area")Â andÂ [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume"). From those, some other global quantities can be derived byÂ [integrating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral")Â local contributions.

Riemannian geometry originated with the vision ofÂ [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann")Â expressed in his inaugural lecture "_Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen_" ("On the Hypotheses on which Geometry is Based").Â It is a very broad and abstract generalization of theÂ [differential geometry of surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces")Â inÂ [**R**3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"). Development of Riemannian geometry resulted in synthesis of diverse results concerning the geometry of surfaces and the behavior ofÂ [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic")Â on them, with techniques that can be applied to the study ofÂ [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold")Â of higher dimensions. It enabled the formulation ofÂ [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'sÂ [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_theory_of_relativity "General theory of relativity"), made profound impact onÂ [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory")Â andÂ [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory"), as well asÂ [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_analytic_function "Global analytic function"), and spurred the development ofÂ [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology")Â andÂ [differential topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology "Differential topology").
