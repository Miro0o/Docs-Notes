## Intro
HDLs have been around for a few decades. The earliest of these were proprietary languages supplied by chip fabricators. One of these languages, Verilog, created by Gateway Design Automation in 1983, became one of the two leading design languages by the end of the twentieth century. In 1989, Cadence Design Systems bought Gateway, and in the next year, it released Verilog into the public domain. Verilog became an IEEE standard in 1995, the latest version of which is IEEE 1364-2001.

Because it was patterned after the **C programming language**, Verilog is considered an easy language to learn. With C being a popular language for writing embedded systems software, engineers can shift between writing software and designing hardware with relative ease. Verilog produces netlists at two levels of abstraction.
- The highest level, the register transfer level (RTL), uses constructs akin to any C language program, with variables replaced by registers and signals.
- When necessary, Verilog can also model circuits at the gate and transistor levels.
