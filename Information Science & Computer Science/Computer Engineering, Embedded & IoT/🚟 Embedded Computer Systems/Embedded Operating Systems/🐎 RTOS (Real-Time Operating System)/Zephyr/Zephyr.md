## Intro

The Zephyr Project is a scalable real-time operating system (RTOS) supporting multiple hardware architectures, optimized for resource constrained devices, and built with security in mind.

The Zephyr OS is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated smart watches and IoT wireless gateways.

The Zephyr kernel supports multiple architectures, including ARM (Cortex-A, Cortex-R, Cortex-M), Intel x86, ARC, Nios II, Tensilica Xtensa, and RISC-V, SPARC, MIPS, and a large number of [supported boards](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html).

## Getting Started

Welcome to Zephyr! See the [Introduction to Zephyr](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/introduction/index.html) for a high-level overview, and the documentation's [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) to start developing.



## Community Support

Community support is provided via mailing lists and Discord; see the Resources below for details.
