### Five Hypotheses
1. The Acquisition Learning Hypothesis: There is a distinct difference between acquiring and learning a second language.

2. The Monitor Hypothesis: The formal study of language leads to the development of an internal grammar monitor.

3.  The Natural Order Hypothesis: Language learners acquire the rules of language in a predictable order.

4. The Input Hypothesis: The acquisition of a second language is the direct result of learners‚Äô understanding the target language in natural communication situations.

5.  The Affective Filter Hypothesis: The most important affective variables favoring second language acquisition are a low anxiety-learning environment, student motivation to learn the language, self-confidence and self-esteem.
