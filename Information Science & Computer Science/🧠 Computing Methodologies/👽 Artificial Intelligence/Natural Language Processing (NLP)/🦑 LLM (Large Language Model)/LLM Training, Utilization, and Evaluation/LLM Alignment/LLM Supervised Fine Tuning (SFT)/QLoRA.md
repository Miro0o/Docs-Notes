## Intro
"QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs", an effort to democratize access to LLM research.

QLoRA uses [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) for quantization and is integrated with Hugging Face's [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) and [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/) libraries. QLoRA was developed by members of the [University of Washington's UW NLP group](https://twitter.com/uwnlp?s=20).
