### CUDA Toolkit
🏠 https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit

Develop, Optimize and Deploy GPU-Accelerated Apps

The NVIDIA® CUDA® Toolkit provides a development environment for creating high performance GPU-accelerated applications. With the CUDA Toolkit, you can develop, optimize, and deploy your applications on GPU-accelerated embedded systems, desktop workstations, enterprise data centers, cloud-based platforms and HPC supercomputers. The toolkit includes GPU-accelerated libraries, debugging and optimization tools, a C/C++ compiler, and a runtime library to deploy your application.

Using built-in capabilities for distributing computations across multi-GPU configurations, scientists and researchers can develop applications that scale from single GPU workstations to cloud installations with thousands of GPUs.

#### [DLAMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/what-is-dlami.html)
The AWS Deep Learning AMI (DLAMI) is your one-stop shop for deep learning in the cloud. This customized machine instance is available in most Amazon EC2 regions for a variety of instance types, from a small CPU-only instance to the latest high-powered multi-GPU instances. It comes preconfigured with [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) and [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), as well as the latest releases of the most popular deep learning frameworks.
