## Intro
> `Qdrant` - High-performance, massive-scale Vector Database for the next generation of AI. Also available in the cloud

**`Qdrant`** (read: _quadrant_) is a vector similarity search engine and vector database. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points—vectors with an additional payload Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.

`Qdrant` is written in Rust 🦀, which makes it fast and reliable even under high load. See [benchmarks](https://qdrant.tech/benchmarks/).

With `Qdrant`, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more!

`Qdrant` is also available as a fully managed **[Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/)** ⛅ including a **free tier**.
