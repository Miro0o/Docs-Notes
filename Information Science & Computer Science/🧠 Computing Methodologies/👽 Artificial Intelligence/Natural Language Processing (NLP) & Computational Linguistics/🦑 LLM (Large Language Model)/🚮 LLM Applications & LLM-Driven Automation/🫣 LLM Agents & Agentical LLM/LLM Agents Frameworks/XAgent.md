## Intro
XAgent is an open-source experimental Large Language Model (LLM) driven autonomous agent that can automatically solve various tasks. It is designed to be a general-purpose agent that can be applied to a wide range of tasks. XAgent is still in its early stages, and we are working hard to improve it.

🏆 Our goal is to create a super-intelligent agent that can solve any given task!
