## Intro
When dealing with real-time information or specialized domain knowledge, LLMs may struggle to generate accurate outputs solely based on their internal knowledge. To address this issue, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique [1024, 1025] has been proposed by incorporating external knowledge source for improving the model response. This technique aims to retrieve relevant information from external sources (e.g., the internet or domain-specific knowledge bases) using an information retrieval system, thereby providing LLMs with timely or domain-relevant context to reduce the factual errors in generated content. In the format, RAG can also be considered as a specific prompting strategy that integrates auxiliary information from external sources into the original prompt.
