## Intro
### Deploy LLM on Different Levels - Desktop and Production
To explain these two deployments, take the comparison of ollama and vLLM for example (generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash):
#vLLM #ollama #LLM #software_deployment

While both Ollama and vLLM are tools for LLM inference (running a model), their **design goals** and **primary use cases** are fundamentally different:

| **Aspect**             | **Ollama**                                                                                                    | **vLLM (Very Large Language Model)**                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Goal**       | **Simplicity and Accessibility.** To make it easy to run LLMs locally for prototyping and personal use.       | **High-Throughput and Efficiency.** To maximize LLM serving performance in production.                       |
| **Target Environment** | Local machines, developer laptops, single-user setups.                                                        | Production servers, cloud deployments, multi-GPU clusters.                                                   |
| **Performance**        | Good for single-user, low-concurrency requests. Prioritizes a simple user experience over raw speed at scale. | **Significantly Higher Throughput and Lower Latency** under heavy, concurrent load.                          |
| **Key Optimization**   | **Quantization** and easy packaging for resource-constrained hardware.                                        | **PagedAttention** (efficient memory management) and **Continuous Batching** (efficient request scheduling). |
| **Hardware Focus**     | Consumer-grade hardware (CPU and GPU) and Apple Silicon.                                                      | High-end, dedicated GPUs (like NVIDIA A100s/H100s).                                                          |
| **User Experience**    | Simple CLI and API, minimal setup. **Beginner-friendly.**                                                     | More complex setup, focused on advanced configuration for production needs. **Engineer-focused.**            |
| **Model Scope**        | Curated model library that are pre-packaged.                                                                  | Works with a wide range of models from the Hugging Face ecosystem.                                           |
