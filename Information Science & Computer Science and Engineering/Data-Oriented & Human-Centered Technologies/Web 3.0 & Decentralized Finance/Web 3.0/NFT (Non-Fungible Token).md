A **non-fungible token** (**NFT**) is a unique digital identifier that is recorded on a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain "Blockchain") and is used to certify ownership and authenticity. It cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided. The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded. Initially pitched in 2017 as a new class of [investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment "Investment") asset, by September 2023 one report claimed that over 95% of NFT collections had zero [monetary value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_value "Monetary value").

NFTs can be created by anybody and require little or no coding skill to create. NFTs typically contain references to [digital files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_file "Digital file") such as artworks, photos, videos, and audio. Because NFTs are uniquely identifiable, they differ from [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrencies "Cryptocurrencies"), which are [fungible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungible "Fungible") (hence the name non-fungible token).

Proponents claim that NFTs provide a public [certificate of authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_authenticity "Certificate of authenticity") or [proof of ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_\(property\) "Title (property)"), but the legal rights conveyed by an NFT can be uncertain. The ownership of an NFT as defined by the blockchain has no inherent legal meaning and does not necessarily grant [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright"), [intellectual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property "Intellectual property") rights, or other legal rights over its associated digital file. An NFT does not restrict the sharing or copying of its associated digital file and does not prevent the creation of NFTs that reference identical files.

NFT trading increased from US$82 million in 2020 to US$17 billion in 2021. NFTs have been used as [speculative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation "Speculation") investments and have drawn criticism for the energy cost and [carbon footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint "Carbon footprint") associated with some types of blockchain, as well as their use in [art scams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick "Confidence trick"). The NFT market has also been compared to an [economic bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble "Economic bubble") or a [Ponzi scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme "Ponzi scheme"). In 2022, the NFT market collapsed; a May 2022 estimate was that the number of sales was down over 90% compared to 2021.
