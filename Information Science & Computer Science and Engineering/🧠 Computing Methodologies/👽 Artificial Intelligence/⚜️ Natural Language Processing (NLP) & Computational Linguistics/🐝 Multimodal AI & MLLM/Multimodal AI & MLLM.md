- In summary, our findings demonstrate that many features activating for plain text descriptions of concepts also activate for, and can generate, text-based visual depictions of those concepts. We showed this through: (1) using features to recognize entities within text-based visual formats like ASCII and SVG, and (2) steering features to transform visual depictions, e.g., turning smiles into frowns and faces into unicorns.
