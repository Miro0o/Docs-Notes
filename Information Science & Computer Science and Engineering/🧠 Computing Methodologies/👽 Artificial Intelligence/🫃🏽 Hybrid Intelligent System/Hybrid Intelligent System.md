**Hybrid intelligent system** denotes a software system which employs, in parallel, a combination of methods and techniques from artificial intelligence subfields, such as:
- [Neuro-symbolic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI "Neuro-symbolic AI")
- [Neuro-fuzzy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-fuzzy "Neuro-fuzzy") systems
- Hybrid connectionist-symbolic models
- Fuzzy [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system "Expert system")
- [Connectionist expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionist_expert_system "Connectionist expert system")
- [Evolutionary neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_neural_network "Evolutionary neural network")
- [Genetic fuzzy systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fuzzy_system "Genetic fuzzy system")
- [Rough fuzzy hybridization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_fuzzy_hybridization "Rough fuzzy hybridization")
- [Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning "Reinforcement learning") with fuzzy, neural, or evolutionary methods as well as symbolic reasoning methods.

From the [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science") perspective, every natural intelligent system is hybrid because it performs mental operations on both the symbolic and subsymbolic levels. For the past few years, there has been an increasing discussion of the importance of [A.I. Systems Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Systems_Integration "A.I. Systems Integration"). Based on notions that there have already been created simple and specific [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI "AI") systems (such as systems for [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"), [speech synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis "Speech synthesis"), etc., or software that employs some of the models mentioned above) and now is the time for integration to create broad [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI "AI") systems. Proponents of this approach are researchers such as [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky"), [Ron Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Sun "Ron Sun"), [Aaron Sloman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sloman "Aaron Sloman"), [Angelo Dalli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Dalli "Angelo Dalli") and [Michael A. Arbib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Arbib "Michael A. Arbib").

An example hybrid is a [hierarchical control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_control_system "Hierarchical control system") in which the lowest, reactive layers are sub-symbolic. The higher layers, having relaxed time constraints, are capable of reasoning from an abstract world model and performing [planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning "Automated planning") (even by hybrid wisdom).

Intelligent systems usually rely on hybrid reasoning processes, which include [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning"), [deduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning"), [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning") and reasoning by [analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy "Analogy").
