## Intro

**Automated planning and scheduling**, sometimes denoted as simply **AI planning**, is a branch of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") that concerns the realization of [strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy "Strategy") or action sequences, typically for execution by [intelligent agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent "Intelligent agent"), [autonomous robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot "Autonomous robot") and [unmanned vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_vehicle "Unmanned vehicle"). Unlike classical [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system "Control system") and [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification "Statistical classification") problems, the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space. Planning is also related to [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory "Decision theory").

In known environments with available models, planning can be done offline. Solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution. In dynamically unknown environments, the [strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy "Strategy") often needs to be revised online. Models and policies must be adapted. Solutions usually resort to iterative [trial and error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error "Trial and error") processes commonly seen in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"). These include [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming "Dynamic programming"), [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning "Reinforcement learning") and [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization "Combinatorial optimization"). Languages used to describe planning and scheduling are often called [action languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_language "Action language").
