**Robot learning** is a research field at the intersection of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") and [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"). It studies techniques allowing a robot to acquire novel skills or adapt to its environment through learning algorithms. The embodiment of the robot, situated in a physical embedding, provides at the same time specific difficulties (e.g. high-dimensionality, real time constraints for collecting data and learning) and opportunities for guiding the learning process (e.g. sensorimotor synergies, motor primitives).

Example of skills that are targeted by learning algorithms include sensorimotor skills such as locomotion, grasping, active [object categorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_recognition "Object recognition"), as well as interactive skills such as joint manipulation of an object with a human peer, and linguistic skills such as the grounded and situated [meaning of human language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding "Natural-language understanding"). Learning can happen either through autonomous self-exploration or through guidance from a human teacher, like for example in robot learning by imitation.

Robot learning can be closely related to [adaptive control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control "Adaptive control"), [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning "Reinforcement learning") as well as [developmental robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_robotics "Developmental robotics") which considers the problem of autonomous lifelong acquisition of repertoires of skills. While [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") is frequently used by [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision") algorithms employed in the context of robotics, these applications are usually not referred to as "robot learning".
