Kimi K2 Thinking is the latest, most capable version of open-source thinking model. Starting with Kimi K2, we built it as a thinking agent that reasons step-by-step while dynamically invoking tools. It sets a new state-of-the-art on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), BrowseComp, and other benchmarks by dramatically scaling multi-step reasoning depth and maintaining stable tool-use across 200–300 sequential calls. At the same time, K2 Thinking is a native INT4 quantization model with 256k context window, achieving lossless reductions in inference latency and GPU memory usage.
