In this section, we give a brief introduction to multi-agent RL or MARL. Our presentation is based on [ACS24]. MARL is closely related to game theory (see e.g. [LBS08]) and multi-agent systems design (see e.g. [SLB08]), as we will see. For other surveys on MARL, see e.g. [HLKT19; YW20; Won+22; GD22].
