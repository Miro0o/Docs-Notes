**Knowledge representation** (**KR**) aims to model information in a structured manner to formally represent it as [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") in knowledge-based systems whereas **knowledge representation** **and reasoning** (**KRR**, **KR&R**, or **KR²**) also aims to understand, reason, and interpret knowledge. KRR is widely used in the field of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") (AI) with the goal to represent [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information") about the world in a form that a computer system can use to solve complex tasks, such as [diagnosing a medical condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_diagnosis "Computer-aided diagnosis") or [having a natural-language dialog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_user_interface "Natural language user interface"). KR incorporates findings from psychology about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge, in order to design [formalisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system") that make complex systems easier to design and build. KRR also incorporates findings from [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") to automate various kinds of _reasoning_.

Traditional KRR focuses more on the declarative representation of knowledge. Related knowledge representation formalisms mainly include [vocabularies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary "Vocabulary"), [thesaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus "Thesaurus"), [semantic networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network "Semantic network"), [axiom systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_system "Axiom system"), [frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_\(artificial_intelligence\) "Frame (artificial intelligence)"), [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_system "Rule-based system"), [logic programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming "Logic programming"), and [ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_\(information_science\) "Ontology (information science)"). Examples of [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning "Automated reasoning") engines include [inference engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_engine "Inference engine"), [theorem provers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving "Automated theorem proving"), [model generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem "Boolean satisfiability problem"), and [classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification "Statistical classification").

In a broader sense, parameterized models in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") — including [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_\(machine_learning\) "Neural network (machine learning)") architectures such as [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network "Convolutional neural network") and [transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_\(deep_learning_architecture\) "Transformer (deep learning architecture)") — can also be regarded as a family of knowledge representation formalisms. The question of which formalism is most appropriate for knowledge-based systems has long been a subject of extensive debate. For instance, Frank van Harmelen et al. discussed the suitability of logic as a knowledge representation formalism and reviewed arguments presented by anti-logicists. Paul Smolensky criticized the limitations of symbolic formalisms and explored the possibilities of integrating it with connectionist approaches.

More recently, Heng Zhang et al. have demonstrated that all universal (or equally expressive and natural) knowledge representation formalisms are recursively isomorphic. This finding indicates a theoretical equivalence among mainstream knowledge representation formalisms with respect to their capacity for supporting [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence") (AGI). They further argue that while diverse technical approaches may draw insights from one another via recursive isomorphisms, the fundamental challenges remain inherently shared.
