In [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics"), the **metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor** (**MOSFET**, **MOS-FET**, **MOS FET**, or **MOS transistor**) is a type of [field-effect transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor "Field-effect transistor") (FET), most commonly fabricated by the [controlled oxidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_oxidation "Thermal oxidation") of [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon"). It has an insulated gate, the [voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage") of which determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic [signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal "Signal"). The term _metal–insulator–semiconductor field-effect transistor_ (_MISFET_) is almost synonymous with _MOSFET_. Another near-synonym is _insulated-gate field-effect transistor_ (_IGFET_).

The main advantage of a MOSFET is that it requires almost no input current to control the load current under steady-state or low-frequency conditions, especially compared to [bipolar junction transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor "Bipolar junction transistor") (BJTs). However, at high frequencies or when switching rapidly, a MOSFET may require significant current to charge and discharge its gate capacitance. In an _enhancement mode_ MOSFET, voltage applied to the gate terminal increases the conductivity of the device. In _depletion mode_ transistors, voltage applied at the gate reduces the conductivity.

The "metal" in the name MOSFET is sometimes a [misnomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnomer "Misnomer"), because the gate material can be a layer of [polysilicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysilicon "Polysilicon") (polycrystalline silicon). Similarly, "oxide" in the name can also be a misnomer, as different dielectric materials are used with the aim of obtaining strong channels with smaller applied voltages.

The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor in [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_circuit "Digital circuit") circuits, as billions may be included in a [memory chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_chip "Memory chip") or [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor"). As MOSFETs can be made with either a p-type or n-type channel, complementary pairs of MOS transistors can be used to make switching circuits with very low power consumption, in the form of [CMOS logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS_logic "CMOS logic").

<small>Shown is a conceptual diagram of a gate-all-around (GAA) field-effect transistor. GAA transistors are the successor to “Fin” transistors (FinFETs) since GAA transistors can work at characteristic length scales below 7 nm. GAA transistors have many 3D interfaces, which poses a challenging boundary value problem during design analysis. <br><a>https://www.nist.gov/image/conceptual-diagram-gate-all-around-gaa-field-effect-transistor</a></small>
