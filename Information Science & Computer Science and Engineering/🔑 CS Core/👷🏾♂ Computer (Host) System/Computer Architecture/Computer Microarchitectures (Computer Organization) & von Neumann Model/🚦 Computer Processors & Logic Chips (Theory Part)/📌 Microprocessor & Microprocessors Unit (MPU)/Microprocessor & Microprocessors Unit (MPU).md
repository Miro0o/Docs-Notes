> Is a GPU a Microprocessor? How to define microprocessor?
> 
> **Technically: Yes.** **Socially: No.**
> - **The Technical View:** A "Microprocessor" is simply a processing unit contained on a single integrated circuit (chip). Since a GPU fits this description perfectly, it is physically a type of microprocessor.
> - **The "Street" View:** In the industry, if you say "Microprocessor," people assume you mean the main **CPU** (Central Processing Unit). Because the GPU is specialized for graphics and parallel math, ==we usually classify it as a **"Coprocessor"** or simply an **"Accelerator."**==
> 
> **The Key Difference:**
> - **Microprocessor (CPU):** Designed for **General Purpose** work (running Windows, opening Word, checking email).
> - **GPU:** Designed for **Specific** work (calculating the color of millions of pixels at once).

> 
> - **Tensor Processing Unit abbreviation TPU** is a custom-built integrated circuit developed specifically for machine learning and tailored for TensorFlow, Google's open-source machine learning framework. TPU’s have been powering Google data centers since 2015, however Google still uses CPUs and GPUs for other types of machine learning.  
> - TPU can handle **upto 128000 operations** per cycle  
> - A co-processor designed to accelerate deep learning tasks develop using TensorFlow (a programming framework); Compilers have not been developed for TPU which could be used for general purpose programming; hence, it requires significant effort to do general programming on TPU

A **digital signal processor** (**DSP**) is a specialized microprocessor chip, with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of [digital signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing "Digital signal processing").

DSPs are fabricated on [MOS integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") chips.

DSPs are widely used in [audio signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_processing "Audio signal processing"), [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications "Telecommunications"), [digital image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing "Digital image processing"), [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar "Radar"), [sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar "Sonar")and [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition") systems, and in common [consumer electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronic "Consumer electronic") devices such as [mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones "Mobile phones"), [disk drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_drives "Disk drives") and [high-definition television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television "High-definition television") (HDTV) products.
