## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard

A **motherboard** (also called **mainboard**, **main circuit board**, **MB**, **mboard**, **backplane board**, **base board**, **system board**, **mobo**; or in Apple computers logic board) is the main **printed circuit board (PCB)** in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.

**Motherboard means specifically a PCB with expansion capabilities**. As the name suggests, this board is often referred to as the mother of all components attached to it, which often include peripherals, interface cards, and daughterboards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, host bus adapters, TV tuner cards, IEEE 1394 cards, and a variety of other custom components.

Similarly, the term **mainboard** describes a device with a single board and no additional expansions or capability, such as controlling boards in laser printers, television sets, washing machines, mobile phones, and other [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system") with limited expansion abilities

Modern motherboards contain firmware stored in non-volatile memory such as [ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM "ROM"), [EPROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPROM "EPROM"), [EEPROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM "EEPROM"), or [NOR flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOR_flash "NOR flash"), which is responsible for initializing system hardware and loading an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") from a [boot device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_device "Boot device"). The terms _booting_ and _bootstrapping_ derive from the metaphor "pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps", reflecting the self-starting nature of the process.

以常见的家用Intel桌面版的CPU为例，Intel 10th Gen Core（CPU处理器）通过 495系列芯片组和外围低速设备连接。好了，现在处理低速设备的PCH（旧称南桥芯片组）还是有的，不过已经集成到CPU里了，名字改了功能小变化，承担角色没变。见下图：
