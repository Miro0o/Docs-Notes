Neural Engine is a series of AI accelerators designed for machine learning by Apple. Neural Engine was first introduced with the A11 Bionic system-on-a-chip (SoC), used in the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X from 2017.[1] In 2020, Apple introduced its M1 processor for its Mac computers[2] which also used a Neural Engine. Every A-series and M-series processor since 2017 has included a Neural Engine.[3]

Apple services such as its Siri virtual assistant, Face ID facial recognition and Apple Intelligence AI services are powered by the Neural Engine,[4] and since this is handled on-device, user data is secure.[5]
