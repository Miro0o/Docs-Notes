## Intro

In [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory "Automata theory"), **combinational logic** (also referred to as **time-independent logic**) is a type of [digital logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_logic "Digital logic") that is implemented by [Boolean circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_circuit "Boolean circuit"), where the output is a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function "Pure function") of the present input only. This is in contrast to [sequential logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_logic "Sequential logic"), in which the output depends not only on the present input but also on the history of the input. In other words, sequential logic has _[memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_storage "Computer storage")_ while combinational logic does not.

Combinational logic is used in [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") circuits to perform [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_\(logic\) "Boolean algebra (logic)") on input signals and on stored data. Practical computer circuits normally contain a mixture of combinational and sequential logic. For example, the part of an [arithmetic logic unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit "Arithmetic logic unit"), or ALU, that does mathematical calculations is constructed using combinational logic. Other circuits used in computers, such as [half adders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_adder "Half adder"), [full adders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_adder "Full adder"), [half subtractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_subtractor "Half subtractor"), [full subtractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_subtractor "Half subtractor"), [multiplexers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer "Multiplexer"), [demultiplexers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer "Multiplexer"), [encoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_encoder "Simple encoder") and [decoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decoder "Binary decoder") are also made by using combinational logic.

Practical design of combinational logic systems may require consideration of the finite time required for practical logical elements to react to changes in their inputs. Where an output is the result of the combination of several different paths with differing numbers of switching elements, the output may momentarily change state before settling at the final state, as the changes propagate along different paths.
