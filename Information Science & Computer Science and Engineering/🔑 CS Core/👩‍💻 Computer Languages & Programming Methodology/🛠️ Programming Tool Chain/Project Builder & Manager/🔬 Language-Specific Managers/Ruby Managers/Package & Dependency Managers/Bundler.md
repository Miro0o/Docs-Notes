## Intro
> **Bundler is now maintained in the [rubygems/rubygems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) repository.**

**Bundler is a per-project dependency manager for ruby.** 

Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.

Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as `bundle install`.
