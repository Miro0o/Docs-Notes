## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC

**WebRTC** (**Web Real-Time Communication**) is a free and open-source project providing web browsers and mobile applications with **real-time communication (RTC)** via **↗ [API (Application Program Interface)](../../../../../👷🏾‍♂️%20Computer%20(Host)%20System/Computer%20Interfaces%20&%20Hardware%20Drivers/API%20(Application%20Program%20Interface).md)**. It allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps.

Supported by [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc."), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google"), [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft"), [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla "Mozilla"), and [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Software "Opera Software"), WebRTC specifications have been published by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium "World Wide Web Consortium") (W3C) and the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") (IETF).
According to the webrtc.org website, the purpose of the project is to "enable rich, high-quality RTC applications to be developed for the browser, mobile platforms, and IoT devices, and allow them all to communicate via a common set of protocols.

**Although initially developed for web browsers**, WebRTC has applications for non-browser devices, including mobile platforms and IoT devices. WebRTC is used for **video chats and meetings on video calling platforms, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack or Google Meet**. Industries, including healthcare, surveillance and monitoring, and internet of things, use WebRTC.

Otherwise known as Web Real-Time Communications, WebRTC is an open-source project - promoted by Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and others - it enables plugin-free Real Time Communications via Javascript API. It facilitates web browser to browser applications for voice calling, screen sharing, video chat, video conferencing and file sharing. The supported [codec](https://www.3cx.com/pbx/codecs/ "Different Types of Codecs") for WebRTC is currently [VP8](https://www.3cx.com/pbx/vp8/ "What is VP8"). WebRTC uses a server called Web Conferencing Server that in conjunction with a [STUN Server](https://www.3cx.com/pbx/what-is-a-stun-server/ "What is STUN server")  it is required to provide the initial page and synchronize the connections between two WebRTC endpoints.


### WebRTC Samples
> 🔗 https://webrtc.github.io/samples/

This is a collection of small samples demonstrating various parts of the [WebRTC APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API). The code for all samples are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/webrtc/samples).

Most of the samples use [adapter.js](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter), a shim to insulate apps from spec changes and prefix differences.

[https://webrtc.org/getting-started/testing](https://webrtc.org/getting-started/testing "Command-line flags for WebRTC testing") lists command line flags useful for development and testing with Chrome.

Patches and issues welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.

> **Warning:** It is highly recommended to use headphones when testing these samples, as it will otherwise risk loud audio feedback on your system.
