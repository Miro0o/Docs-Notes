## Intro

==The essence of dynamic programming is to avoid repeated calculation with **memoization**.== That's read "memoization" (like we are writing in a memo pad) not memorization.
- Often, dynamic programming problems are naturally solvable by recursion. In such cases, it's easiest to write the recursive solution, then save repeated states in a lookup table. This process is known as **top-down dynamic programming with memoization**. 
- However, besides top-down DP we can also solve problems with **bottom-up dynamic programming**. Bottom-up is exactly the opposite of top-down, you start at the bottom (base cases of the recursion), and extend it to more and more values.

One of the most basic, classic examples of this process is the fibonacci sequence. Compare these three versions of C implementation of fibonacci sequence: 

```c++
// #1. recursive implementation of Fib (not DP, since there's no memoization)
// top-bottum approach: from the request value to the base cases.

// time complexity: O(2^n)


int f(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    return f(n - 1) + f(n - 2);
}
```

```c++
// #2. recursive implementation of Fib with memoization (Top-Down DP)
// top-bottum approach: from the request value to the base cases.
// there are various other containers to do memoization, map, unordered_map, etc.

// time compelxity: O(n)


const int MAXN = 100;
bool found[MAXN];
int memo[MAXN];

int f(int n) {
    if (found[n]) return memo[n];
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;

    found[n] = true;
    return memo[n] = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2);
}
```

```c++
// #3. for-loop implementation of Fib with memoization (Buttom-up DP)
// buttom-up approach: from the base cases to the target value.

// time compelxity: O(n)
// space complexity: O(n)


const int MAXN = 100;
int fib[MAXN];

int f(int n) {
    fib[0] = 0;
    fib[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];

    return fib[n];
}


// ================================================
//
// #3.5 refined version of #3. implementation, reducing space compelxity to O(1)
// time compelxity: O(n)
// space complexity: O(1)


const int MAX_SAVE = 3;
int fib[MAX_SAVE];

int f(int n) {
    fib[0] = 0;
    fib[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
        fib[i % MAX_SAVE] = fib[(i - 1) % MAX_SAVE] + fib[(i - 2) % MAX_SAVE];

    return fib[n % MAX_SAVE];
}
```


That's it. That's the basics of dynamic programming: Don't repeat the work you've done before.

One of the tricks to getting better at dynamic programming is to study some of the classic examples:
