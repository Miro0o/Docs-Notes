## Forensic Tools



## Counter-Forensics
**Common Tricks**
- Time & metadata tampering
	- Tools like timestomp, EXIF cleaners, or manual system clock changes
- Log manipulation
	- Event log clearing (wevtutil cl), disabling auditing, forced rotation
- Wiping and privacy tools
	- CCleaner, BleachBit, sdelete, SSD TRIM effects
- Ephemeral activity
	- Private/incognito browsing, temporary storage, encrypted or cloud-only volumes

**Common Tools**
Metasploit Framework (post-exploitation modules)
- Use: Several post-modules can clear **Windows Event Logs** after exploitation
- Examples:
	- `post/windows/manage/clearlogs` → clears Application, System, and Security logs
	- `post/multi/gather/log_wiper` (community modules)
- Pros: Automatable, scriptable, integrates with other actions

PowerShell & Sysinternals (Windows)
- Very common:
	- `wevtutil cl <logname>` → clears specific Windows Event Logs
	- `Clear-EventLog cmdlet` → quick batch clearing
	- `Sysinternals SDelete` → securely wipes deleted log files to make recovery harder
- Often combined in scripts to clear or selectively truncate logs

Linux: shell + logrotate
- `> /var/log/auth.log`
- `> /var/log/syslog`
or edit logrotate configs to rotate-and-delete targeted logs immediately
Some adversaries also deploy custom cron jobs to keep wiping recent entries



## Anti-Counter-Forensics
**Spot the Gap — Timeline Correlation**
- Even if logs are wiped, **their absence itself is evidence**.
- Typical signs:
	- Log files exist, but their internal sequence IDs restart suddenly
	- There’s a suspicious “quiet” period in logs between otherwise normal activity
	- Timestamps around the log files (modification / creation) don’t match expected patterns
- Build system-wide timelines (e.g. with Autopsy, Plaso, or log2timeline) and look for:
	- When the log file .evtx was last modified
	- What happened just before and after that timestamp
	- Any associated events (e.g. privilege escalation, remote shell access) preceding the wipe

**Check other artifacts**
- Even if Windows Event Logs are cleared, other subsystems keep traces:
	- `$MFT / $UsnJrnl`
		- Shows the log file being truncated or rewritten (new record)
	- `SetupAPI.dev.log / Prefetch / Shimcache / Amcache`
		- Can show tools or executables run shortly before the wipe (e.g. wevtutil.exe, Metasploit payloads, PowerShell)
	- Command history / PowerShell Operational logs
		- Sometimes attackers forget to clear everything
	- SRUM / WMI / Task Scheduler logs
		- Provide indirect timing signals
- Document the Wipe as a finding
	- Timestamp of wipe, affected logs, correlated surrounding activity, confidence level
