Welcome to **Software Security: Principles, Policies, and Protection (SS3P)**, a free book about software security. SS3P focuses on basic software security principles, secure software development from design over implementation to testing, software security policies (with a focus on memory and type **un**safe language like C/C++), defense strategies with a focus on verification, testing, and mitigation, attack vectors, and reverse engineering. The different chapters are augmented with several case studies.

This book is, was, and always will be **free** and **openly accessible**. If you reference the book, please link to this page, the [SS3P PDF](https://nebelwelt.net/SS3P/softsec.pdf), or [SS3P epub](https://nebelwelt.net/SS3P/softsec.epub) so that your readers will always get the most recent version.

Topics
- **Software and System Security Principles**: from basic security properties to assess the security of a system like Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability to Isolation, Least Privilege, Compartmentalization, and Threat Modeling with a stint into the discussion on differences between bugs and vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Software Life Cycle**: integration of security into design, implementation, and testing of a software project and how to continuously keep track of a software's security properties throughout the life time of the project.
- **Memory and Type Safety**: the two core policies that cause the majority of exploitable vulnerabilities on current systems. Understand the definitions and implications regarding performance and security.
- **Attack Vectors**: understand the goals of an attacker and how these goals may be achieved starting from a program crash.
- **Defense Strategies**: verify if the complexity of the code is manageable, test as much as you can, and leverage mitigations to constrain the attacker on the remaining attack surface.
- **Case Studies**: end to end discussion of web security (including the browser security model) and mobile security.
- **Appendix**: discussion on shellcode development and reverse engineering.
