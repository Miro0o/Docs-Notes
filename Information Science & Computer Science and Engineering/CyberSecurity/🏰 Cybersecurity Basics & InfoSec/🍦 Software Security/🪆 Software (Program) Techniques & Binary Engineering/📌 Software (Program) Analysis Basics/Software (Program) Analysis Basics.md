Back in the beginning of 20th century, a group of logician where obsessed with coming up with a system for proving all things in mathematics. The problem was that a [foundational crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics#Foundational_crisis) had emerged. Many mathematical theories had holes in them, or was able to prove theorems which are false [E.g ., Russell's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox).

To this end they came up with different systems for **automatically proving things**. David Hilbert came up with the [Hilbert's program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program), and Alanzo Church came up with the [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). The underlying idea was, if we could come up with an automatic procedure for producing everything that is true, we can recursively enumerate all true things. This is known as recursively axiomatizable.

However, they quickly ran into a problem: how can we prove that these programs actually terminate? This is the fundamental program analysis question, and it strangely came before the program.

---
**What is a Program?**
To talk about program analysis, we first have to define what we mean when we say _program_. A program in the context of this course is going to be a **_structured object_** that exhibit some _behavior_ when executed.

> [!DEF]
> **Definition 1**: Program (↗ [The Essence of Computing - Programs & The Semantics of Programs](../../../../../🗺%20CS%20Overview/The%20Essence%20of%20Computing%20-%20Programs%20&%20The%20Semantics%20of%20Programs.md))
> 
> There are several definitions of program. 
> 
> A program is structured object $p\in L$, from a language L, with a step function from state to state: 𝚜𝚝𝚎𝚙: $𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞 \to 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞$
> 
> A program = data + instruction

==When executing a program, we often want to run it until it changes the state. This is called a **_fixpoint_**, or running the program to completion.==

---
**What is Program Analysis?** 
**_Program analysis_** is the art of extracting facts about the structure or the possible behavior from a program. These facts could be: does the program eventually come to a halt, is the program well-formatted, or will my program exhibit a bug ... etc.

In summary, program analysis is
- ==Using automatic techniques to figure out facts about a computer program.==

For simple languages, it is relatively easy to figure out what they do. For example, `1 + 2` will always execute to `3`. But, program analysis, in general, is extremely hard.

> In computer science, program analysis[1] is the process of analyzing the behavior of computer programs regarding a **property** such as correctness, robustness, safety and liveness. Program analysis focuses on two major areas: program optimization and program correctness. The first focuses on improving the program’s performance while reducing the resource usage while the latter focuses on ensuring that the program does what it is supposed to do.
> - other areas are like program security : )

> 📖 Principles of Program Analysis (2005) Flemming Nielson, Hanne R. Nielson

One common theme behind all approaches to program analysis is that in order to remain computable one can only provide **safe-approximate answers**. 

Another common theme, to be stressed throughout this book, is that all program analyses should be **semantics based**: this means that the information obtained from the analysis can be proved to be safe (or correct) with respect to a semantics of the programming language. It is a sad fact that new program analyses often contain subtle bugs, and a formal justification of the program analysis will help finding these bugs sooner rather than later. However, we should stress that we do not suggest that program analyses be semantics directed: this would mean that the structure of the program analysis should reflect the structure of the semantics and this will be the case only for a few approaches which are not covered in this book.

**Why Program Analysis?**
Program Reliability
- Null pointer dereference, memory leak, etc.
Program Security
- Private information leak, injection attack, etc.
Compiler Optimization
- Dead code elimination, code motion, etc.
Program Understanding
- IDE call hierarchy, type indication, etc.

**A Turing-Complete Mess**
🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness

We are going to focus most our energy on programs from languages that are _Turing complete_. Turing complete languages are languages in which you can write any program executable on a machine. This class of programs is also what you are mostly familiar with. Java, C, Python, etc ., are all Turing complete languages. Even [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) and [PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3loq22TxSc) are Turing complete.

Using a Turing complete language is a double edge sword: while it is nice that it is powerful enough to do everything, it is also powerful enough to:
- fire the missiles,
- **not** fire the missiles,
- never terminate,
- kill grandma, and worst of all
- throw a null pointer exception!

So it would be nice be warned if any of these things might happen. However, that turns out to be very hard.

**The Halting problem**

> [!links]
> ↗ [Computability (Recursion) Theory - Turing Machine and R.E. Language](../../../../../🧮%20Mathematics/🤼‍♀️%20Mathematical%20Logic%20(Foundations%20of%20Mathematics)/😶‍🌫️%20Theory%20of%20Computation/Computability%20(Recursion)%20Theory%20-%20Turing%20Machine%20and%20R.E.%20Language/Computability%20(Recursion)%20Theory%20-%20Turing%20Machine%20and%20R.E.%20Language.md)
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem

Consider the base of all analysis problems, the halting problem:

> [!DEF]
> **Definition 2**: The Halting Problem
> Given **any** program $p \in L$ from the language $L$, decide if it is going to terminate (halt) when executed on a state $s$.

This problem turns out to be impossible to solve correctly for all programs of a Turing complete language. It is in fact _undecidable_. While for some programs it is easy to say with confidence that it does terminate. We can't build an mechanical procedure which can do this for every program.

The argument goes a little like this. Consider you have a mechanical procedure for solving the halting problem, in that case we can encode it as a program:

```python
def does_halt(p : Program) -> bool:
    ...
```

Now we can use this program in another program:

```python
def main():
    while does_halt(main):
        print("Running")
```

This is a weird program: We can see that if `main` halts, it runs forever, and if it runs forever it will eventually halt. This is of course impossible, which strongly suggest that `does_halt` cannot exist.

---
**General Undecidability of Program Analysis & Rice's Theorm**

We could hope that the problem that we can't figure out if a program terminates or not is special and does not affect any of the other things we would like to know about the program. But, sadly this is not the case. **Almost any interesting thing you would like to know about the behavior of the program can be _reduced_ to the halting problem.** This fact is called **_Rice's theorem_**.

> [!TIP]
> 🔗 [Rice's Theorem | wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice's_theorem)
> 
> In [computability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory "Computability theory"), **Rice's theorem** states that all non-trivial semantic properties of programs are [undecidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem "Undecidable problem"). A _semantic_ property is one about the program's behavior (for instance, "does the program [terminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem "Halting problem") for all inputs?"), unlike a syntactic property (for instance, "does the program contain an [if-then-else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-then-else "If-then-else") statement?"). A _non-trivial_ property is one which is neither true for every program, nor false for every program.
> 
> The theorem generalizes the undecidability of the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem "Halting problem"). It has far-reaching implications on the feasibility of [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis "Static program analysis") of programs. It implies that it is impossible, for example, to implement a tool that checks whether any given program is [correct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_\(computer_science\) "Correctness (computer science)"), or even executes without error (it is possible to implement a tool that always overestimates or always underestimates, so in practice one has to decide what is less of a problem).
> 
> The theorem is named after [Henry Gordon Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gordon_Rice "Henry Gordon Rice"), who proved it in his doctoral dissertation of 1951 at [Syracuse University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_University "Syracuse University").

For example, since figuring out the halting problem is impossible, we can't say if the following problem actually fires the nukes:

```python
def main():
    something_that_might_go_forever()
    fire_the_nukes()
```

However, all hope is not lost! Although it's mathematically impossible to make a **perfect** program analysis, one can still make it a **useful** program analysis.
#### Soundness, Truth, and Completeness

> 🔗 https://courses.compute.dtu.dk/02242/topics/introduction.html##sec:1.6

In most cases, you either care that something _may_ happen, or that it _must_ happen. In the program from before, we can quite easily say that it **may** fire the nukes. If we do not want the nukes from not being fired, we can flag this as a bug. However, we might also build a missile luncher, in which case the nukes **must** be fired when press the red button.

These kinds of analyses allows us to error one of the sides. Here we steal some nomenclature from ↗ [Formal System, Formal Logics, and Its Semantics](../../../../../🧮%20Mathematics/🤼‍♀️%20Mathematical%20Logic%20(Foundations%20of%20Mathematics)/📍%20Formal%20System,%20Formal%20Logics,%20and%20Its%20Semantics/Formal%20System,%20Formal%20Logics,%20and%20Its%20Semantics.md). In logic **_soundness_** means that every provable statement is true, and **_completeness_** means that every true statement is provable.

Translated into program analysis jargon, we say an analysis is sound if when it produce a fact, then that is a real fact, and complete if it always can find a fact about the program if it is there. ==Because the problem we are talking about is **undecidable**, we CANNOT both be sound and complete.==

**A Note: Soundness Confusion**
One problem with the use of soundness and completeness in program analysis, is that depending of the culture and essentially the underlying question, soundness and completeness can mean the same thing. A sound analysis that reject buggy programs is the same as a complete analysis finds bugs in programs.

**Program based questions focus on if the program is well formed.** Essentially, a sound analysis must only accept correct programs, and a complete analysis accept all correct analysis. This is often used with type-systems and static analyses.

Trace based questions focus on if the program contains an execution that ends in a state which contains a bug. In that case a sound analysis will only find correct traces, and complete analysis will find all traces. This is mostly used in dynamic analyses.

==In case of confusion, use **may** and **must** instead.==
##### Necessity of Soundness
- Soundness is critical to a collection of important (static-analysis) applications such as _compiler optimization_ and _program verification._
- ![](../../../../../../Assets/Pics/Screenshot%202025-11-11%20at%2023.37.45.png)
- Soundness is also preferable to other (static-analysis) applications for which soundness is not demanded, e.g., _bug detection_, as better soundness implies more bugs could be found.
##### A Relaxed Goal: Approximative Answers
> 📖 Static Program Analysis | Anders Møller and Michael I. Schwartzbach

While it is impossible to build an analysis that would correctly decide a property for any analyzed program, it is often possible to build analysis tools that give useful answers for most realistic programs. As the ideal analyzer does not exist, there is always room for building more precise approximations (which is colloquially called the full employment theorem for static program analysis designers).

Approximative answers may be useful for finding bugs in programs, which may be viewed as a weak form of ↗ [program verification](../../../../⛈️%20Risk%20Management/🦟%20Vulnerabilities/ICT%20System%20Reliability%20(Correctness)%20&%20Verification.md). 

> 🔗 [In Defense of Soundness: A Manifesto](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2644805)
> [...], virtually all published whole program analyses are unsound and omit conservative handling of common language features when applied to real programming languages.

#### FP,TN,FN 🆚 TP
It is also useful to talk about how a program analysis has performed on individual programs or bugs. To do this we use nomenclature from [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification).

An individual proposition $\Phi$ is either a true positive, true negative, false positive, or false negative, following the table below:

|                            | $(\Sigma \models \Phi)$ | $(\Sigma \not\models \Phi)$ |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| $(\Sigma \vdash \Phi)$     | True Positive           | False Positive              |
| $(\Sigma \not\vdash \Phi)$ | False Negative          | True Negative               |

![](../../../../../../Assets/Pics/Pasted%20image%2020250908234329.png)

==A sound analysis, therefore, has no false positives, and a complete analysis has no false negatives.==
#### Soundy & Soundiness
> 🔗 https://blog.wohin.me/posts/nju-program-analysis-15-16/

现在，我们来记录一下最后一节课学习的知识。

[第一节课](https://blog.wohin.me/posts/nju-program-analysis-01/#sound--complete)中，我们曾学习过sound和complete的概念。通常情况下，我们总是选择牺牲completeness，保全soundness。Soundness是一个理想的状态——捕获程序的全部行为、分析出所有可能的执行结果。事实上，无论是在学术界还是工业界，全程序分析通常都是unsound，这是因为现代编程语言通常都有一些难以进行静态分析的hard features。例如，Java中有反射（reflection）、native code、动态类加载等；JavaScript中有eval函数，文档对象模型（DOM）等；C/C++中有指针运算、函数指针等。

因此，通常情况下，学术界和工业界有一些现象和做法：
- 一个所谓的sound的静态分析，只是在实现上有一个sound core，也就是对绝大多数语言特性做了over-approximated处理，但是某些难以分析的部分则是under-approximated处理。
- 略去hard language features的处理，或者只是在实现或评估部分简单地提一下。
- 未能考虑到hard language features，导致分析结果有问题。

鉴于这些现象，2015年，领域内人士提出了Soundiness一词，类比Truthiness（指某个truth只是某些人相信的，但没有事实或证据支持），对应的形容词是soundy，希望大家能够用合适的词汇准确描述自己的研究。现在我们可以说，一个sound的分析需要捕获全部动态行为，这通常是不可能实现的；一个soundy的分析希望去捕获全部动态行为，但是对于部分hard language features的unsoundly处理给出了解释；一个unsound的分析是主观上忽略了部分行为，从而达到更好的效率、准确性或可行性。

接着，作为示例，李樾老师分析了Java的反射和native code两个hard language features，探讨为什么它们难于分析，以及学术界的研究进展。事实上，反射部分最先进的研究是李樾和谭添老师做的。这可以说是顶级“凡尔赛”了，但是哪个学生不希望听到老师说课程最前沿的部分是自己做的呢？换句话说，能听顶尖工作的作者讲的该领域的课应该是一种荣幸。

简单来说，Java反射机制难于进行静态分析的原因是，`Class.forName(cName)`、`c.getMethod(mName, ...)`等方法的参数可能是运行时才能确定的（来自网络、配置文件、用户输入等），静态分析很难获得这些参数信息，进而难于确定对应的类和方法。学术界目前的解决方法可以归为三类：
1. 字符串常量分析+指针分析（[论文链接](https://suif.stanford.edu/papers/aplas05r.pdf)）。这个思路比较直观，但是也存在明显的问题——如果字符串的值确实是运行时才能确定的，那么就无法确定反射目标了。
2. 类型推理+字符串分析+指针分析（[论文链接](https://yuelee.bitbucket.io/papers/ECOOP14.pdf)，一二作是李樾、谭添）。这个思路是从反射对象的使用点（usage points）开始反推。值得一提的是，2019年，两位老师又发表了[新的研究成果](https://yuelee.bitbucket.io/papers/tosem19.pdf)。
3. 动态分析辅助的静态分析（[论文链接](https://www.bodden.de/pubs/bss+11taming.pdf)）。这个不必多言，就是从动态分析中获取信息来辅助进行静态分析，它会有动态分析的优点，但是也因此引入了动态分析的缺点。

Java native code难于分析的原因则是跨语言——最终会调用到C语言动态链接库中的代码。当前的一个解决思路是对关键的native code进行手动建模（用Java实现）。这里附上2020年的一个[研究进展](https://yanniss.github.io/native-issta20.pdf)。

<small>I really like this slide by Julian Cohen's Contemporary Automatic Program Analysis talk (<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0nHId1umvY</a>). In a nutshell, people like to divide program analysis into two broad categories of static and dynamic analysis. But there is really a broad spectrum of program analysis techniques that range from static to dynamic and manual to fully automatic. Symbolic execution is an interesting technique that falls somewhere in between static and dynamic analysis and is generally applied as a fully automatic approach. <br>

- Manual vs Automatic Analysis
	- The difference between manual and automatic analysis, is whether we have a well-defined procedure for analyzing the code.
	- In many cases manual inspection is a crucial companion to automatic analysis. If taken to the extreme, we can actually require the user of the tool to prove to us that the code is correct. Now we only have to check the proof, which case we are entering the world of _Program Verification_.
- Syntactic (↗ [SCA (Static Code Analysis) & SAST](👚%20SCA%20(Static%20Code%20Analysis)%20&%20SAST/SCA%20(Static%20Code%20Analysis)%20&%20SAST.md), ↗ [Syntactic Analysis (Parsing)](../../../../../🔑%20CS%20Core/🛣️%20Programming%20Language%20Processing%20&%20Program%20Execution/🚮%20Program%20Language%20Processing%20&%20Compilation%20Theory%20(Compile-time)/Compilation%20Phase/1️⃣%20Frontend%20-%20Programming%20Language%20Analysis/Syntactic%20Analysis%20(Parsing)/Syntactic%20Analysis%20(Parsing).md)) vs Semantic Analysis (↗ [The Essence of Computing - Programs & The Semantics of Programs](../../../../../🗺%20CS%20Overview/The%20Essence%20of%20Computing%20-%20Programs%20&%20The%20Semantics%20of%20Programs.md))
	- The difference between a syntactic and a semantic analysis is whether we focus on the **structure** of the program or on the **meaning** of the program.
	- The structure of the program or syntax is often represented as a tree of nodes as recognized by the parser. In contrast the meaning of the program or semantics is represented as a set of all possible traces of a program. Here trace means a sequence of states and operations possible by the program.
	- In the realm of program analysis for security, most of the time we are talking about semantic analysis. Analysis below semantic analysis, like syntactic analysis and lexical analysis, are mostly used in ↗ [Program Language Processing & Compilation Theory (Compile-time)](../../../../../🔑%20CS%20Core/🛣️%20Programming%20Language%20Processing%20&%20Program%20Execution/🚮%20Program%20Language%20Processing%20&%20Compilation%20Theory%20(Compile-time)/Program%20Language%20Processing%20&%20Compilation%20Theory%20(Compile-time).md). 
- ↗ [SCA (Static Code Analysis) & SAST](👚%20SCA%20(Static%20Code%20Analysis)%20&%20SAST/SCA%20(Static%20Code%20Analysis)%20&%20SAST.md) 🆚 ↗ [DCA (Dynamic Code Analysis) & DAST](👙%20DCA%20(Dynamic%20Code%20Analysis)%20&%20DAST/DCA%20(Dynamic%20Code%20Analysis)%20&%20DAST.md)
	- Finally we can differentiate between dynamic and static analysis. A dynamic analysis interpolates the meaning of the program from a single trace, where a static analysis tries to predict all possible behaviors.
	- Dynamic analysis are often just executing the programs, and then reporting any behavior it exhibits. An dynamic analysis often have proof of the bad behavior. A dynamic analysis is **sound** if every behavior it finds is a real behavior, and **complete** if can find all behaviors.
		- Dynamic analysis starts with one single initial state, and explore some states along the path from that initial state (not necessarily all states)
	- Static analyses in contrast consider the entire programs, and then reports if the program is without bugs or problems. When a good static analysis says your program is good, it probably is, however, when it finds a potential bug, it can often not prove it to you. A static analysis is **sound** if every program it flags do exhibit some behavior, and **complete** if it flags all programs that contain the behavior.
		- Static analysis starts with ALL initial states (at once), and then explore (hopefully) all states following. However, there is a distinction in how far (the depth) we explore in all following states, which further divides static analysis into bounded static analysis and unbounded static analysis.
	- It is sometimes a great idea to do a mix of a dynamic and static analysis, in which case we call it a **_hybrid_ analysis**.


**Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_application_security_testing

Interactive application security testing (abbreviated as IAST) is a security testing method that detects software vulnerabilities by interaction with the program coupled with observation and sensors. The tool was launched by several application security companies. It is distinct from static application security testing, which does not interact with the program, and dynamic application security testing, which considers the program as a black box. It may be considered a mix of both
