## Intro
### What's a design pattern?
**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

You can’t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.


### What does the pattern consist of?
Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
