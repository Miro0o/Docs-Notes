**λ-calculus, combinatory logic, and object calculus are not logics by themselves** in the sense of having built-in notions of _truth_, _validity_, or _models_.

They are **formal calculi of computation**.
However:
- They can **encode logics**
- They can **be given logical interpretations**
- Some become logics once you add **types, propositions, or semantics**
So we must distinguish:
- **Raw calculus**
- **Typed / logical interpretation**

**Logic asks “what is true?”  
Calculus asks “what computes?”**
Typed calculi sit exactly at the **bridge** between the two.

|System|Logic?|Order|Truth Semantics|
|---|---|---|---|
|Untyped λ-calculus|❌|Higher-order|None|
|Typed λ-calculus|✔ (via CH)|Higher-order|Intuitionistic|
|Dependent λ-calculus|✔|Higher-order|Intuitionistic|
|Untyped combinatory logic|❌|Higher-order|None|
|Typed combinatory logic|✔|Higher-order|Intuitionistic|
|Object calculus (untyped)|❌|Higher-order|None|
|Object calculus (typed)|Partial|Higher-order|Usually intuitionistic|

Why These Are Still “Logical” in Spirit
They connect to logic through:
- Curry–Howard Correspondence
	- λ-terms ↔ proofs
	- Types ↔ propositions
	- Reduction ↔ proof normalization
- Internal Languages of Categories
	- Cartesian closed categories ↔ typed λ-calculus
	- Toposes ↔ higher-order intuitionistic logic
- Encodability
	- Classical logic can be embedded (via double-negation)
	- Modal logic via monads or type constructors

- λ-calculus and combinatory logic are **computational cores**
- They become **higher-order logics** when:
    - Types are added
    - Propositions are identified with types
- Object calculus formalizes **computation with state and structure**
- Truth semantics emerge **only after interpretation**
