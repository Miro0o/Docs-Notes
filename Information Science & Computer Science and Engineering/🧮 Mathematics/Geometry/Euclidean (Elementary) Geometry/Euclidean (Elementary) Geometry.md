欧氏几何是第一个提出的公理系统。

大家应该都听说过欧几里得[第五公设](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%B3%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%AC%E8%A8%AD)的故事，欧几里得采用了公理化的方式构建了几何学，其中第五公设又称平行公设，它既不能被其他公设证明，也不能证否，两千年来，在第五公设问题上，耗费了无数年轻数学家的生命和心血。

> 如果两条直线与第三条直线相交时，在第三条直线的某一侧三条线所夹的内角之和小于两个直角的和，则那两条直线沿着这一侧延伸足够长之后必然相交

1820年左右，俄国喀山大学教授[罗巴切夫斯基](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B0%BC%E5%8F%A4%E6%8B%89%C2%B7%E7%BD%97%E5%B7%B4%E5%88%87%E5%A4%AB%E6%96%AF%E5%9F%BA)提出了一个与第五公设相矛盾的命题，然后与欧几里得的前四个公设结合成一个公理系统，展开一系列的推理。他认为如果这个系统在推理中出现矛盾，就等于证明了第五公设，此即数学中的反证法。

但是，在他极为细致深入的推理过程中，得出了一个又一个在直觉上匪夷所思，但在逻辑上毫无矛盾的命题。这在当时是一件很难理解的事情，因为人们一致认为，欧几里得几何是物质空间中图形性质的正确理想化。正确的几何结论不应该与我们的直观感受不符。

现在看来，这样理解当然是有问题的，因为，它混淆了公理系统中的结论，和对这些结论的解释。就好像上文中我们为“pq”系统增加了新公理一样，新定理仍然是正确推导的产物，只是不能沿用旧方式进行解释了。

关于欧几里得第五公设，最终人们得到了三种常用的几何学，称为欧几里得几何，罗巴切夫斯基几何，以及黎曼几何。这些公理系统，对研究不同的数学对象起到了关键作用。

Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to Euclid, an ancient Greek mathematician, which he described in his textbook on geometry, Elements. Euclid's approach consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms (postulates) and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. One of those is the parallel postulate which relates to parallel lines on a Euclidean plane. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated earlier,[1] Euclid was the first to organize these propositions into a logical system in which each result is proved from axioms and previously proved theorems.[2]

The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school (high school) as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of mathematical proofs. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.[1]

For more than two thousand years, the adjective "Euclidean" was unnecessary because Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the parallel postulate) that theorems proved from them were deemed absolutely true, and thus no other sorts of geometry were possible. Today, however, two other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries are known, hyperbolic and elliptic geometry. An implication of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and Euclidean space is a good approximation for it only over short distances or weak gravity.[3]

Euclidean geometry is an example of synthetic geometry, in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects. This is in contrast to analytic geometry, introduced almost 2,000 years later by René Descartes, which uses coordinates to express geometric properties by means of algebraic formulas.


### The Elements
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#The_Elements

The _Elements_ is mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. Its improvement over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.

There are 13 books in the _Elements_:

Books I–IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, for example, "In any triangle, two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles." (Book I proposition 17) and the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem "Pythagorean theorem") "In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle." (Book I, proposition 47)

Books V and VII–X deal with [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), with numbers treated geometrically as lengths of line segments or areas of surface regions. Notions such as [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_numbers "Prime numbers") and [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") and [irrational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number "Irrational number") are introduced. It is proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

Books XI–XIII concern [solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry "Solid geometry"). A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base. The [platonic solids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid "Platonic solid") are constructed.


### Axioms
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms

Euclidean geometry is an [axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system"), in which all [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem") ("true statements") are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of [non-Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry "Non-Euclidean geometry"), these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true. However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independently from the physical reality.

Near the beginning of the first book of the _Elements_, Euclid gives five [postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulate "Postulate") (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):
Let the following be postulated:
1. To draw a [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") from any [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_\(geometry\) "Point (geometry)") to any point.
2. To produce (extend) a [finite straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment "Line segment") continuously in a straight line.
3. To describe a [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle") with any centre and distance (radius).
4. That all [right angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle "Right angle") are equal to one another.
5. [The [parallel postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate "Parallel postulate")]: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.

Although Euclid explicitly only asserts the existence of the constructed objects, in his reasoning he also implicitly assumes them to be unique.

The _Elements_ also include the following five "common notions":
1. Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another (the [transitive property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_property "Transitive property") of a [Euclidean relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_relation "Euclidean relation")).
2. If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal (Addition property of equality).
3. If equals are subtracted from equals, then the differences are equal (subtraction property of equality).
4. Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another (reflexive property).
5. The whole is greater than the part.

Modern scholars agree that Euclid's postulates do not provide the complete logical foundation that Euclid required for his presentation. Modern [treatments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry "Foundations of geometry") use more extensive and complete sets of axioms.
