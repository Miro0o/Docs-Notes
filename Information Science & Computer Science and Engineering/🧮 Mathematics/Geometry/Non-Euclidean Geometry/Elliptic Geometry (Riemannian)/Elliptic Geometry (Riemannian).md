**Riemannian geometry** is the branch of [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") that studies [Riemannian manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_manifold "Riemannian manifold"). An example of a Riemannian manifold is a [surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_\(mathematics\) "Surface (mathematics)"), on which distances are measured by the length of curves on the surface. Riemannian geometry is the study of surfaces and their higher-dimensional analogs (called manifolds), in which distances are calculated along curves belonging to the manifold. Formally, Riemannian geometry is the study of [smooth manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") with a _Riemannian metric_ (an [inner product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product "Inner product") on the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") at each point that varies [smoothly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function "Smooth function") from point to point). This gives, in particular, local notions of [angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle"), [length of curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length "Arc length"), [surface area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area "Surface area") and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume "Volume"). From those, some other global quantities can be derived by [integrating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") local contributions.

Riemannian geometry originated with the vision of [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann") expressed in his inaugural lecture "_Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen_" ("On the Hypotheses on which Geometry is Based"). It is a very broad and abstract generalization of the [differential geometry of surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry_of_surfaces "Differential geometry of surfaces") in [**R**3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space "Three-dimensional space"). Development of Riemannian geometry resulted in synthesis of diverse results concerning the geometry of surfaces and the behavior of [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") on them, with techniques that can be applied to the study of [differentiable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold "Differentiable manifold") of higher dimensions. It enabled the formulation of [Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_theory_of_relativity "General theory of relativity"), made profound impact on [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory "Group theory") and [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory "Representation theory"), as well as [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_analytic_function "Global analytic function"), and spurred the development of [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology") and [differential topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology "Differential topology").
