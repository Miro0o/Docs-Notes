**Maple** is a [symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation "Symbolic computation") and [numeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis") computing environment as well as a [multi-paradigm programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm#Multi-paradigm "Programming paradigm"). It covers several areas of technical computing, such as symbolic mathematics, numerical analysis, data processing, visualization, and others. A toolbox, [MapleSim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapleSim "MapleSim"), adds functionality for multidomain physical modeling and code generation.

Maple's capacity for symbolic computing include those of a general-purpose [computer algebra system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system "Computer algebra system"). For instance, it can manipulate mathematical expressions and find symbolic solutions to certain problems, such as those arising from ordinary and partial [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations "Differential equations").

Maple is developed commercially by the Canadian software company [Maplesoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maplesoft "Maplesoft"). The name 'Maple' is a reference to the software's [Canadian heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Canada "Flag of Canada").

JGEX is a software which combines dynamic geometry software (DGS), automated geometry theorem prover (GTP) and our approach for visually dynamic presentation of proofs. As a dynamic geometry software, JGEX can be used to build dynamic visual models to assist teaching and learning of various mathematical concepts. As an automated reasoning software, we can build dynamic logic models which can do reasoning themselves. As a tool for dynamic presentation of proofs, JGEX is a valuable for teachers and students to write and present proofs of geometry theorems with various dynamic visual effects.



## 👉 manim

Manim is an engine for precise programmatic animations, designed for creating explanatory math videos.

Note, there are two versions of manim. This repository began as a personal project by the author of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) for the purpose of animating those videos, with video-specific code available [here](https://github.com/3b1b/videos). In 2020 a group of developers forked it into what is now the [community edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/), with a goal of being more stable, better tested, quicker to respond to community contributions, and all around friendlier to get started with. See [this page](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/installation.html#different-versions) for more details.

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS

SPSS Statistics is a statistical software suite developed by IBM for data management, advanced analytics, multivariate analysis, business intelligence, and criminal investigation. Long produced by SPSS Inc., it was acquired by IBM in 2009. Versions of the software released since 2015 have the brand name IBM SPSS Statistics.

The software name originally stood for **Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)**, reflecting the original market, then later changed to **Statistical Product and Service Solutions**.



## 👉 Stata
🏠 https://www.stata.com/

> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata

Stata (/ˈsteɪtə/, STAY-ta, alternatively /ˈstætə/, occasionally stylized as STATA) is a general-purpose statistical software package developed by StataCorp for data manipulation, visualization, statistics, and automated reporting. It is used by researchers in many fields, including biomedicine, economics, epidemiology, and sociology.

Stata was initially developed by Computing Resource Center in California and the first version was released in 1985. In 1993, the company moved to College Station, Texas and was renamed Stata Corporation, now known as StataCorp. A major release in 2003 included a new graphics system and dialog boxes for all commands. Since then, a new version has been released once every two years. The current version is Stata 19, released in April 2025.
