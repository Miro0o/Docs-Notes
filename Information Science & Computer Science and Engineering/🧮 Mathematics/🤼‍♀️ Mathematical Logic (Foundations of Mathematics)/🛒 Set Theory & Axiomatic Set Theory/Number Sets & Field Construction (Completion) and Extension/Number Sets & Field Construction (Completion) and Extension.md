Generally speaking, each arrow involves the addition of some new symbols and the axioms that provide their definitions and / or properties. Some boxes have multiple incoming arrows; these are systems constructed from the union of multiple sets of new symbols and axioms. Note also that the relationships represented by the arrows are, in general, transitive.</small>
