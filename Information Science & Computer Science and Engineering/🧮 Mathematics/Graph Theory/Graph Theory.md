In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), **graph theory** is the study of _[graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_\(discrete_mathematics\) "Graph (discrete mathematics)")_, which are [mathematical structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structures "Mathematical structures") used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of _[vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_\(graph_theory\) "Vertex (graph theory)")_ (also called _nodes_ or _points_) which are connected by _[edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge "Glossary of graph theory terms")_ (also called _arcs_, _links_ or _lines_). A distinction is made between **undirected graphs**, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and **directed graphs**, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically. Graphs are one of the principal objects of study in [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics "Discrete mathematics").
