In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **tensor** is an [algebraic object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") that describes a [multilinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_map "Multilinear map") relationship between sets of [algebraic objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure") associated with a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space"). Tensors may map between different objects such as [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_\(mathematics_and_physics\) "Vector (mathematics and physics)"), [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_\(mathematics\) "Scalar (mathematics)"), and even other tensors. There are many types of tensors, including [scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_\(mathematics\) "Scalar (mathematics)") and [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_\(mathematics_and_physics\) "Vector (mathematics and physics)") (which are the simplest tensors), [dual vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_vector "Dual vector"), [multilinear maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilinear_map "Multilinear map") between vector spaces, and even some operations such as the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product "Dot product"). Tensors are defined [independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_\(intrinsic_definition\) "Tensor (intrinsic definition)") of any [basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_\(linear_algebra\) "Basis (linear algebra)"), although they are often referred to by their components in a basis related to a particular coordinate system; those components form an array, which can be thought of as a high-dimensional [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_\(mathematics\) "Matrix (mathematics)").

Tensors have become important in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), because they provide a concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving physics problems in areas such as [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics") ([stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_\(mechanics\) "Stress (mechanics)"), [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_\(physics\) "Elasticity (physics)"), [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid mechanics"), [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia "Moment of inertia"), etc.), [electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism "Classical electromagnetism") ([electromagnetic tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_tensor "Electromagnetic tensor"), [Maxwell tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_stress_tensor "Maxwell stress tensor"), [permittivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permittivity "Permittivity"), [magnetic susceptibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility "Magnetic susceptibility"), etc.), and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") ([stress–energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor "Stress–energy tensor"), [curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor "Riemann curvature tensor"), etc.). In applications, it is common to study situations in which a different tensor can occur at each point of an object. For example, the stress within an object may vary from one location to another. A family of tensors, that vary across space in this way, is a [tensor field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_field "Tensor field"). In some areas, tensor fields are so ubiquitous that they are often simply called "tensors".

[Tullio Levi-Civita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Levi-Civita "Tullio Levi-Civita") and [Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorio_Ricci-Curbastro "Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro") popularised tensors in 1900 – continuing the earlier work of [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann "Bernhard Riemann"), [Elwin Bruno Christoffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwin_Bruno_Christoffel "Elwin Bruno Christoffel"), and others – as part of the _[absolute differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_differential_calculus "Absolute differential calculus")_. The concept enabled an alternative formulation of the intrinsic [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") of a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") in the form of the [Riemann curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor "Riemann curvature tensor").
