## Intro

n [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), an **algebra over a field** (often simply called an **algebra**) is a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") equipped with a [bilinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map "Bilinear map") [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_\(mathematics\) "Product (mathematics)"). Thus, an algebra is an [algebraic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure") consisting of a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_\(mathematics\) "Set (mathematics)") together with operations of multiplication and addition and [scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication "Scalar multiplication") by elements of a [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_\(mathematics\) "Field (mathematics)") and satisfying the axioms implied by "vector space" and "bilinear".

The multiplication operation in an algebra may or may not be [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative "Associative"), leading to the notions of [associative algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_algebra "Associative algebra") where associativity of multiplication is assumed, and [non-associative algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-associative_algebra "Non-associative algebra"), where associativity is not assumed (but not excluded, either). Given an integer _n_, the [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_\(mathematics\) "Ring (mathematics)") of [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_matrix "Real matrix") [square matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrix "Square matrix") of order _n_ is an example of an associative algebra over the field of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") under [matrix addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_addition "Matrix addition") and [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication "Matrix multiplication") since matrix multiplication is associative. Three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space") with multiplication given by the [vector cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_cross_product "Vector cross product") is an example of a nonassociative algebra over the field of real numbers since the vector cross product is nonassociative, satisfying the [Jacobi identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_identity "Jacobi identity") instead.

An algebra is **unital** or **unitary** if it has an [identity element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element "Identity element") with respect to the multiplication. The ring of real square matrices of order _n_ forms a unital algebra since the [identity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix "Identity matrix") of order _n_ is the identity element with respect to matrix multiplication. It is an example of a unital associative algebra, a [(unital) ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unital_ring "Unital ring") that is also a vector space.

Many authors use the term _algebra_ to mean _associative algebra_, or _unital associative algebra_, or in some subjects such as [algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry "Algebraic geometry"), _unital associative commutative algebra_.

Replacing the field of scalars by a [commutative ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring "Commutative ring") leads to the more general notion of an [algebra over a ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_over_a_field#Generalization:_algebra_over_a_ring). Algebras are not to be confused with vector spaces equipped with a [bilinear form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_form "Bilinear form"), like [inner product spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space "Inner product space"), as, for such a space, the result of a product is not in the space, but rather in the field of coefficients.
