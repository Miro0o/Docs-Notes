**Dynamical systems theory** is an area of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") used to describe the behavior of [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems "Complex systems") [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system"), usually by employing [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equations "Differential equations") by nature of the [ergodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory "Ergodic theory") of dynamic systems. When differential equations are employed, the theory is called [_continuous dynamical systems_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_time "Continuous time"). From a physical point of view, continuous dynamical systems is a generalization of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), a generalization where the [equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion "Equations of motion") are postulated directly and are not constrained to be [Euler–Lagrange equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation "Euler–Lagrange equation") of a [least action principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action "Principle of least action"). When difference equations are employed, the theory is called [_discrete dynamical systems_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_time "Discrete time"). When the time variable runs over a set that is discrete over some intervals and continuous over other intervals or is any arbitrary time-set such as a [Cantor set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set "Cantor set"), one gets [dynamic equations on time scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_equations_on_time_scales "Dynamic equations on time scales"). Some situations may also be modeled by mixed operators, such as [differential-difference equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential-difference_equations "Differential-difference equations").

This theory deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems, and studies the nature of, and when possible the solutions of, the [equations of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion "Equations of motion") of systems that are often primarily [mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics") or otherwise physical in nature, such as [planetary orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_orbit "Planetary orbit") and the behaviour of [electronic circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit "Electronic circuit"), as well as systems that arise in [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), and elsewhere. Much of modern research is focused on the study of [chaotic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaotic_system "Chaotic system") and bizarre systems.

This field of study is also called just _dynamical systems_, _mathematical dynamical systems theory_ or the _mathematical theory of dynamical systems_.
