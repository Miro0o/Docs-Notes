**Vector calculus** or **vector analysis** is a branch of mathematics concerned with the [differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") and [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral "Integral") of [vector fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field"), primarily in three-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space"), $\mathbb{R}^3$. The term _vector calculus_ is sometimes used as a synonym for the broader subject of [multivariable calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus "Multivariable calculus"), which spans vector calculus as well as [partial differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative") and [multiple integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_integral "Multiple integral"). Vector calculus plays an important role in [differential geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") and in the study of [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"). It is used extensively in physics and engineering, especially in the description of [electromagnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"), [gravitational fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field"), and [fluid flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_flow "Fluid flow").

Vector calculus was developed from the theory of [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion "Quaternion") by [J. Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Willard_Gibbs "J. Willard Gibbs") and [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside") near the end of the 19th century, and most of the notation and terminology was established by Gibbs and [Edwin Bidwell Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson "Edwin Bidwell Wilson") in their 1901 book, _[Vector Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Analysis "Vector Analysis")_, though earlier mathematicians such as [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") pioneered the field. In its standard form using the [cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product "Cross product"), vector calculus does not generalize to higher dimensions, but the alternative approach of [geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra "Geometric algebra"), which uses the [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra "Exterior algebra"), does (see _[§ Generalizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus#Generalizations)_ below for more).
