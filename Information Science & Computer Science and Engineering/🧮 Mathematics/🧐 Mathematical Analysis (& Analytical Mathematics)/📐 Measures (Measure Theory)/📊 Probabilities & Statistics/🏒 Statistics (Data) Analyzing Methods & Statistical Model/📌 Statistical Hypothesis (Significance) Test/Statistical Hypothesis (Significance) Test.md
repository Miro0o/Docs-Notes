## Intro
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_test

A **statistical hypothesis test** is a method of statistical inference used to decide whether the data provide sufficient evidence to reject a particular hypothesis. A statistical hypothesis test typically involves a calculation of a [test statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_statistic "Test statistic"). Then a decision is made, either by comparing the test statistic to a [critical value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_value_\(statistics\) "Critical value (statistics)") or equivalently by evaluating a [_p_-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value "P-value") computed from the test statistic. Roughly 100 [specialized statistical tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statistical_tests "List of statistical tests") are in use and noteworthy.



## Test Statistic
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_statistic

**Test [statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic "Statistic")** is a quantity derived from the [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_\(statistics\) "Sample (statistics)") for [statistical hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing "Statistical hypothesis testing").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_statistic#cite_note-CasellaBerger-1) A hypothesis test is typically specified in terms of a test statistic, considered as a numerical summary of a data-set that reduces the data to one value that can be used to perform the hypothesis test. In general, a test statistic is selected or defined in such a way as to quantify, within observed data, behaviours that would distinguish the [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis "Null hypothesis") from the [alternative hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis "Alternative hypothesis"), where such an alternative is prescribed, or that would characterize the null hypothesis if there is no explicitly stated alternative hypothesis.

An important property of a test statistic is that its [sampling distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_distribution "Sampling distribution") under the null hypothesis must be calculable, either exactly or approximately, which allows [_p_-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value "P-value") to be calculated. A _test statistic_ shares some of the same qualities of a [descriptive statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics "Descriptive statistics"), and many statistics can be used as both test statistics and descriptive statistics. However, a test statistic is specifically intended for use in statistical testing, whereas the main quality of a descriptive statistic is that it is easily interpretable. Some informative descriptive statistics, such as the [sample range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_\(statistics\) "Range (statistics)"), do not make good test statistics since it is difficult to determine their sampling distribution.

Two widely used test statistics are the [t-statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-statistic "T-statistic") and the [F-statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-test "F-test").
