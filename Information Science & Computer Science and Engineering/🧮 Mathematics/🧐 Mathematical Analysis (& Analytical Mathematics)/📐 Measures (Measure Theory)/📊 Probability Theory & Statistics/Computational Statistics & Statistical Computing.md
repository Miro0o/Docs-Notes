**Computational statistics**, or **statistical computing**, is the study which is the intersection of [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and refers to the statistical methods that are enabled by using computational methods. It is the area of [computational science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science "Computational science") (or scientific computing) specific to the mathematical science of [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"). This area is fast developing. The view that the broader concept of computing must be taught as part of general [statistical education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_education "Statistical education") is gaining momentum.

As in [traditional statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") the goal is to transform [raw data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data "Raw data") into [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"), but the focus lies on [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") intensive [statistical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_methods "Statistical methods"), such as cases with very large [sample size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination "Sample size determination") and non-homogeneous [data sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set "Data set").

The terms 'computational statistics' and 'statistical computing' are often used interchangeably, although Carlo Lauro (a former president of the [International Association for Statistical Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_Statistical_Computing "International Association for Statistical Computing")) proposed making a distinction, defining 'statistical computing' as "the application of computer science to statistics", and 'computational statistics' as "aiming at the design of algorithm for implementing statistical methods on computers, including the ones unthinkable before the computer age (e.g. [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_\(statistics\) "Bootstrapping (statistics)"), [simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_simulation "Monte Carlo simulation")), as well as to cope with analytically intractable problems".

The term 'Computational statistics' may also be used to refer to computationally _intensive_ statistical methods including [resampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_\(statistics\) "Resampling (statistics)") methods, [Markov chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo "Markov chain Monte Carlo") methods, [local regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression "Local regression"), [kernel density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation "Kernel density estimation"), [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_networks "Artificial neural networks") and [generalized additive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model "Generalized additive model").
