## 🐕 Computer Science Introduction & Overview
### Why is CS needed?
> 💡 This section only stands for personal views. 

TL;DR
- The universe is made of **objects /maters**. According to different frames of references, objects can be still or in movement. 
	- The movement of objects leads to **energy**.
- One unique existence in the universe: objects that has self-consciousness. The universe thus is divided into objects with self-consciousness and objects without self-consciousness.
- Objects with self-consciousness (humans) exists in the way of **information**.
	- Knowledge is connected information. Language or symbolic system is the media of information.
	- The computation of information and the engineering  to the universe compromise the intelligence of self-consciousness, i.e. human intelligence. Human intelligence demonstrates itself in two dimension: logic ability and sentimental ability.
- The universe is thus compromised of three elements: objects /maters, energy, and information.
- The automation of computation of information gives rise to the study of computer science.
	- The ultimate goal of computer science is to reach to the extreme of computational power, i.e. the ability like human intelligence or beyond that in regard of the computation of information.
	- Strong computational power don't make human-like intelligence, the combination of computational power and engineering ability makes human-like intelligence, or even human ourselves. However, a more widely-accepted version of such intelligence, artificial intelligence, aims to only reach the maximal power of computational ability, ignoring the engineering part.

##### CSAB Classification
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#Fields
> 🔗 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_computer_science

As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software. [CSAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSAB_(professional_organization) "CSAB (professional organization)"), formerly called **Computing Sciences Accreditation Board** — which is made up of representatives of the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery "Association for Computing Machinery") (ACM), and the [IEEE Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society "IEEE Computer Society") (IEEE CS) — identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: _theory of computation_, _algorithms and data structures_, _programming methodology and languages_, and _computer elements and architecture_. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and [symbolic computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation "Symbolic computation") as being important areas of computer science.
##### ACM CCS (Classification of All CS Subjects)
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Computing_Classification_System
> The **ACM Computing Classification System** (**CCS**) is a subject classification system for [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing") devised by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery "Association for Computing Machinery") (ACM). The system is comparable to the [Mathematics Subject Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_Subject_Classification "Mathematics Subject Classification") (MSC) in scope, aims, and structure, being used by the various ACM journals to organize subjects by area.

https://dl.acm.org/ccs
The **2012 ACM Computing Classification System (CCS 2012)** has been developed as a poly-hierarchical ontology that can be utilized in semantic web applications. It replaces the traditional 1998 version of the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS), which has served as the de facto standard classification system for the computing field. It is being integrated into the search capabilities and visual topic displays of the [Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/). It relies on a semantic vocabulary as the single source of categories and concepts that reflect the state of the art of the computing discipline and is receptive to structural change as it evolves in the future. ACM provides 🔍 [a tool within the visual display](https://dl.acm.org/ccs) format to facilitate the application of CCS categories to forthcoming papers and a process to ensure that the CCS stays current and relevant. The CCS visual display has both Interactive and Flat views of the classification tree. You may also opt to download the [CCS SKOS](https://dl.acm.org/pb-assets/dl_ccs/acm_ccs2012-1626988337597.xml) file. The new classification system will play a key role in the development of a people search interface in the ACM Digital Library to supplement its current traditional bibliographic search.

### How to learn CS ?

#### 🤔 Questions Leading my CS Study
> ↗ [🌲 Road To CS /🚀 A Serious CS Roadmap](🌲%20Road%20To%20CS.md#🚀%20A%20Serious%20CS%20Roadmap)
> ↗ [Importance Themes & Ideology in CS](Importance%20Themes%20&%20Ideology%20in%20CS.md)

These questions, from general to specific, speaks the path of what i think every CS students should have follow in systematically learning computer science from zero to profession. Most of these questions are too general and abstract that people rarely take them seriously in learning CS (instead they love solving concrete problems and learning practical techniques). But I believe in undergraduate level study, it's quite beneficial for us to establish this systematical, panoramic view towards computer science as a discipline as a whole, in additional to solid engineering skills or specific domain knowledges in some areas.

**Philosophical Part**
1. What is the Universe?
	1. ↗ [Universe, Self-Awareness, and Intelligence](../../../Universe,%20Self-Awareness,%20and%20Intelligence.md)
	2. What is the life?（什么是生命？）
	3. What is the intelligence? What is Human Beings? （什么是智能（从低级到高级）？人类就是目前唯一已知的高级智能（？））
		1. Difference between human and other life objects? Self-consciousness.
		2. Human intelligence?
			1. Intelligence: computation (of information) + engineering
			2. what is human society /civilization and how did it developed?
				1. self-consciousness leads to needs for society and social activities.
		3. Artificial intelligence? (as in its narrow definition)
			1. computation (of information)
		4. Human-like intelligence?
			1. artificial intelligence + engineering (Embodied AI)
	4. What is knowledge? What is the science?
		1. Knowledge is connected data /information. (so what is data /information?)
		2. Arts and Humanity 🆚 Natural Science ?
		3. Sentiments 🆚 Logics?
		4. (What is academic research?)
